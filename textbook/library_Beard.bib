	Abstract = {Abstract---Computer vision researchers have proved the
feasibility of camera self-calibration ---the estimation of a
camera's internal parameters from an image sequence without
any known scene structure. Various self-calibration algorithms
have been published. Nevertheless, all of the recent sequential
approaches to 3D structure and motion estimation from image
sequences which have arisen in robotics and aim at real-time
operation (often classed as visual SLAM or visual odometry)
have relied on pre-calibrated cameras and have not attempted
online calibration.
In this paper, we present a sequential filtering algorithm
for simultaneous estimation of 3D scene estimation, camera
trajectory and full camera calibration from a sequence of
fixed but unknown calibration. This calibration comprises the
standard projective parameters of focal length and principal
point along with two radial distortion coefficients. To deal with
the large non-linearities introduced by the unknown calibration
parameters, we use a Sum of Gaussians (SOG) filter rather than
the simpler Extended Kalman Filter (EKF).
To our knowledge, this is the first sequential Bayesian
autocalibration algorithm which achieves complete fixed camera
calibration using as input only a sequence of uncalibrated
monocular images. The approach is validated with experimental
results using natural images, including a demonstration of loop
closing for a sequence with unknown camera calibration.},

	Abstract = {Abstract--- Recently, classical pairwise Structure From Motion (SfM) techniques have been combined with non-linear
global optimization (Bundle Adjustment, BA) over a sliding
window to recursively provide camera pose and feature location
estimation from long image sequences. Normally called Visual
Odometry, these algorithms are nowadays able to estimate with
impressive accuracy trajectories of hundreds of meters; either
from an image sequence (usually stereo) as the only input, or
combining visual and propioceptive information from inertial
sensors or wheel odometry.
This paper has a double objective. First, we aim to illustrate
for the first time how similar accuracy and trajectory length
can be achieved by filtering-based visual SLAM methods.
Specifically, a camera-centered Extended Kalman Filter is used
here to process a monocular sequence as the only input, with
6DOF motion estimated. Features are kept live in the filter
while visible as the camera explores forward, and are deleted
from the state once they go out of view.
This permits an increase in the number of tracked features
per frame from tens to around a hundred. While improving the
accuracy of the estimation, it makes computationally infeasible
the exhaustive Branch and Bound search performed by standard JCBB for match outlier rejection. As a second contribution
that overcomes this problem, we present here a RANSAC-like
algorithm that exploits the probabilistic prediction of the filter.
This use of prior information makes it possible to reduce the
size of the minimal data subset to instantiate a hypothesis to the
minimum possible of 1 point, greatly increasing the efficiency
of the outlier rejection stage.
Experimental results from real image sequences covering
trajectories of hundreds of meters are presented and compared
against RTK GPS ground truth. Estimation errors are about
1% of the trajectory for trajectories up to 650 metres.},
	Address = {St. Louis},
	Annote = {This is an interesting paper.  

The key idea is that when multiple measurements are received, RANSAC is used to select a measurement (thus 1-point) and update the state.  Inliers are then found using this updated state.  After the RANSAC process, all inliers are then used to update the state in a normal Kalman update, measurements are then re-evaluated to see if there are additional inliers, which are then included in a second Kalman update.

Should be applicable to both EKF, but also to Riccati observers.

@conference{WangZhaWang19,
	Abstract = {Model predictive control (MPC) has become more relevant to vehicle dynamics control due to its inherent capacity of treating system constraints. However, online optimization from MPC introduces an extensive computational burden for today's onboard microprocessors. To alleviate MPC computational load, several methods have been proposed. Among them, online successive system linearization and the resulting linear time-varying model predictive controller (LTVMPC) is one of the most popular options. Nevertheless, such online successive linearization commonly approximates the original (nonlinear) system by a linear one, which inevitably introduces extra modeling errors and therefore reduces MPC performance. Actually, if the controlled system possesses the "differential flatness" property, then it can be exactly linearized and an equivalent linear model will appear. This linear model maintains all the nonlinear features of the original system and can be utilized to design a flatness-based model predictive controller (FMPC). CarSim-Simulink joint simulations demonstrate that the proposed FMPC substantially outperforms a classical LTVMPC in terms of the path-tracking performance for autonomous vehicles.

	Abstract = {Abstract--- We propose a novel inertial-aided KLT feature tracking method robust to camera ego-motions. The conventional KLT uses images only and its working condition is inherently limited to small appearance change between images. When big optical flows are induced by a camera-ego motion, an inertial sensor attached to the camera can provide a good prediction to preserve the tracking performance. We use a low-grade MEMS-based gyroscope to refine an initial condition of the nonlinear optimization in the KLT. It increases the possibility for warping parameters to be in the convergence region of the KLT.

For longer tracking with less drift, we use the affine photometric model and it can effectively deal with camera rolling and outdoor illumination change. Extra computational cost caused by this higher-order motion model is alleviated by restraining the Hessian update and GPU acceleration. Experimental results are provided for both indoor and outdoor scenes and GPU implementation issues are discussed.},

people who develop MAVs introduce an algorithm for detecting pitch

a straight line that is easily distinguishable. One big reason for
using vision is to account for gusts which for a MAV can cause huge
accelerations in sideslip directions. Using a 900 MHz x86, video

	Abstract = {The application of multivariable adaptive control techniques to flight
control reconfiguration is considered. The objective is to redesign
automatically flight control laws to compensate for actuator failures

reference control are compared. The availability of state measurements
in this application leads to relatively simple algorithms. The respective
advantages and disadvantages of the adaptive algorithms are discussed,
considering their complexity and the assumptions that they require.
An equation-error based algorithm is found to be preferable. Simulations
obtained using a full nonlinear model of a twinengine jet aircraft
are presented. The results demonstrate the ability of the adaptive
algorithms to maintain trim after a failure, to restore tracking
of the pilot commands despite the loss of actuator effectiveness,
and to coordinate the use of the remaining active control surfaces
in order to guarantee the decoupling of the rotational axes. A new
adaptive algorithm with a variable forgetting feature is also used
and is found to yield a useful alternative to covariance resetting
as a solution to covariance wind-up in least-squares algorithms.},

In the specific case of tracking multiple ground targets from an aerial platform, challenges arise due to realistic operating environments such as imperfections in the measurement source. Some popular visual detection techniques include Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi (KLT)-based motion detection, difference imaging, and object feature matching. Each of these algorithmic detectors has fundamental limitations in regard to providing consistent measurements. In this paper we present a scalable detection framework that leverages multiple measurement sources. We also present the recursive random sample consensus (R-RANSAC) algorithm in a data fusion architecture that can simultaneously accommodate multiple measurement sources.

	Abstract = {A path planning algorithm based on multiresolution

cell decomposition of the environment using wavelets

is proposed. The environment is assumed to be given by an

occupancy grid at fine resolution. The algorithm constructs a

cell decomposition at several levels of resolution (cell sizes) and

constructs an optimal path to the destination from the current

location of the agent. At each step the algorithm iteratively

refines a coarse approximation to the path through local

replanning. The replanning process uses previous information

to refine the original cell channel in the immediate area of

the path. This is done efficiently using the wavelet coefficients.

Numerical tests show a speed-up of an order of magnitude

over the baseline algorithm with minimal impact on the overall

optimality of the resulting path. A comparative study with the

well-known D* algorithm is also provided.},

We argue that recursive techniques will become more important both for real-time control applications and also interactive vision applications.

In previously published work we described an algorithm which works well if the same features are visible throughout the sequence. Here we show how to deal with new features in a way that avoids deterioration of the results. The main theoretical advance here is showing how to adjust the system information matrix when scene/camera parameters are removed from the reconstruction. We show how this procedure affects the sparseness of the information matrix, and thus how to achieve an efficient recursive solution to the reconstruction problem},

	Abstract = {The development and application of increasingly autonomous (IA) systems for civil aviation is proceeding at an accelerating pace, driven by the expectation that such systems will return significant benefits in terms of safety, reliability, efficiency, affordability, and/or previously unattainable mission capabilities. IA systems range from current automatic systems such as autopilots and remotely piloted unmanned aircraft to more highly sophisticated systems that are needed to enable a fully autonomous aircraft that does not require a pilot or human air traffic controllers. These systems, characterized by their ability to perform more complex mission-related tasks with substantially less human intervention for more extended periods of time, sometimes at remote distances, are being envisioned for aircraft and for air traffic management and other ground-based elements of the national airspace system. Civil aviation is on the threshold of potentially revolutionary improvements in aviation capabilities and operations associated with IA systems. These systems, however, face substantial barriers to integration into the national airspace system without degrading its safety or efficiency. Autonomy Research for Civil Aviation identifies key barriers and suggests major elements of a national research agenda to address those barriers and help realize the benefits that IA systems can make to crewed aircraft, unmanned aircraft systems, and ground-based elements of the national airspace system. This report develops a set of integrated and comprehensive technical goals and objectives of importance to the civil aeronautics community and the nation. Autonomy Research for Civil Aviation will be of interest to U.S. research organizations, industry, and academia who have a role in meeting these goals.},

Having computed optimal estimates of structure and motion over a small number of initial images, a recursive version of the algorithm (previously reported) recomputes sub optimal estimates given new image data. The algorithm is designed explicitly for real time implementation, and the complexity is proportional to the number of tracked features. 3D projective, affine and Euclidean models of structure and motion recovery have been implemented, incorporating both point and line features into the computation.

	Abstract = {Complementary lter-based algorithms for attitude estimation seek to minimize the
short-comings associated with the MEMS sensors and embedded processors that are fre-
quently used in low-cost unmanned aerial vehicles. Within the complementary lter frame-
work, this paper explores the performance impact of three dierent aspects of attitude
estimation: 1) kinematic propagation, 2) attitude representation, and 3) the assumptions
on the behavior of the angular rate vector between samples. Forward Euler integration
and matrix exponential propagation methods are compared within several attitude rep-
resentations, namely the direction cosine matrix (DCM), quaternions, Euler angles, and
the angle-axis scheme. Assumptions of constant, linear, and quadratic angular velocities
between samples are also examined. The resulting algorithms are evaluated according to
accuracy, computational load, and noise response. Unit tests using analytic inputs and
integration tests using each approach within the complementary lter framework of the
SLUGS autopilot are performed to evaluate algorithm performance against 
ight test data
from an integrated GPS/INS system. The results of the experiments indicate that the
matrix exponential with quaternion attitude representation delivers higher accuracy with
low penalty on the computational burden and no signicant dierence for noise resilience.},

	Abstract = {In this paper we present feedback-based information roadmap (FIRM), a multi-query approach for planning under uncertainty which is a belief-space variant of probabilistic roadmap methods. The crucial feature of FIRM is that the costs associated with the edges are independent of each other, and in this sense it is the first method that generates a graph in belief space that preserves the optimal substructure property. From a practical point of view, FIRM is a robust and reliable planning framework. It is robust since the solution is a feedback and there is no need for expensive replanning. It is reliable because accurate collision probabilities can be computed along the edges. In addition, FIRM is a scalable framework, where the complexity of planning with FIRM is a constant multiplier of the complexity of planning with PRM. In this paper, FIRM is introduced as an abstract framework. As a concrete instantiation of FIRM, we adopt stationary linear quadratic Gaussian (SLQG) controllers as belief stabilizers and introduce the so-called SLQG-FIRM. In SLQG-FIRM we focus on kinematic systems and then extend to dynamical systems by sampling in the equilibrium space. We investigate the performance of SLQG-FIRM in different scenarios.},

The aircraft's closed-loop dynamics are described by means of a hybrid automaton with the hover, transition, level, and recovery operating modes, each one corresponding to a different region of the flight envelope. Linear parameter varying control techniques are employed in hover and level, providing robust local stabilization, and a nonlinear locally input-to-state stable controller provides practical reference tracking to the transition operating mode. These controllers, together with an appropriate choice of reference maneuvers, ensure that a transition from hovered flight to level flight, or vice versa, is achieved. Whenever the aircraft state reaches unexpected values, the recovery controller is triggered in order to drive the aircraft toward stable hovered flight, providing a chance to retry the transition maneuver. The controllers' performance and robustness is assessed within a realistic simulation environment in the presence of sensor noise.},

	Abstract = {Sampling-based optimal planners, such as RRT*, almost-surely converge asymptotically to the optimal solution, but have provably slow convergence rates in high dimensions. This is because their commitment to finding the global optimum compels them to prioritize exploration of the entire problem domain even as its size grows exponentially. Optimization techniques, such as CHOMP, have fast convergence on these problems but only to local optima. This is because they are exploitative, prioritizing the immediate improvement of a path even though this may not find the global optimum of nonconvex cost functions. In this paper, we present a hybrid technique that integrates the benefits of both methods into a single search. A key insight is that applying local optimization to a subset of edges likely to improve the solution avoids the prohibitive cost of optimizing every edge in a global search. This is made possible by Batch Informed Trees (BIT*), an informed global technique that orders its search by potential solution quality. In our algorithm, Regionally Accelerated BIT* (RABIT*), we extend BIT* by using optimization to exploit local domain information and find alternative connections for edges in collision and accelerate the search. This improves search performance in problems with difficult-to-sample homotopy classes (e.g., narrow passages) while maintaining almost-sure asymptotic convergence to the global optimum. Our experiments on simulated random worlds and real data from an autonomous helicopter show that on certain difficult problems, RABIT* converges 1.8 times faster than BIT*. Qualitatively, in problems with difficult-to-sample homotopy classes, we show that RABIT* is able to efficiently transform paths to avoid obstacles.},

	Abstract = {Abstract---Implementation of adaptive backstepping controllers

requires analytic calculation of the partial derivatives

of certain stabilizing functions. It is well documented

that, as the order of a nonlinear system increases, analytic

calculation of these derivatives becomes prohibitive. Therefore,

in practice, either alternative control approaches are

used or the derivatives are neglected in the implementation.

Neglecting the derivatives results in the loss of all

guarantees proven by Lyapunov methods for the adaptive

backstepping approach and may result in instability.

This article presents a new implementation approach

for adaptive backstepping control. The main objectives

are to facilitate the derivation and implementation of

the adaptive backstepping approach, with performance

guarantees proven by Lyapunov methods, for applications

that were prohibitively difficult using the standard analytic

implementation approach. The new approach uses filtering

methods to produce certain command signals and their

derivatives which eliminates the requirement of analytic

differentiation. The approach also introduces filters to generated

certain compensating signals necessary to compute

compensated tracking errors suitable for adaptive parameter

estimation. We present a set of Lemmas and Theorems

to analyze the performance both during the initialization

and the operating phases. We show that the initialization

phase is of finite duration that can be controlled by selection

of a design parameter. We also show that all signals within

the system are bounded during this short initialization

phase. During the operating phase, we show that the

command filtered implementation approach has theoretical

properties identical to those of the conventional approach.

The general approach is presented and analyzed for

systems in generalized parameter strict feedback form.

Extensions of the approach are presented to demonstrate

the application of the method to a land vehicle trajectory

following application. Application and effectiveness of the

proposed method is shown by simulation results.},

We argue that recursive techniques will become more important both for real-time control applications and also interactive vision applications.

In previously published work we described an algorithm which works well if the same features are visible throughout the sequence. Here we show how to deal with new features in a way that avoids deterioration of the results. The main theoretical advance here is showing how to adjust the system information matrix when scene/camera parameters are removed from the reconstruction.

	Abstract = {Abstract---This brief deals with the tracking control design of a
helicopter laboratory experimental setup. In order to be able to
realize highly dynamic flight maneuvers, both input and state constraints
have to be systematically accounted for within the control design
procedure. The mathematical model being considered constitutes a
nonlinear mathematical mechanical system with two control inputs
and three degrees of freedom. The control concept consists of an
inversion-based feedforward controller for trajectory tracking and
a feedback controller for the trajectory error dynamics. The design
of the feedforward controller for a point-topoint flight maneuver
is traced back to the solution of a 2-point boundary value problem
in the Byrnes-Isidori normal form of the mathematical model. By utilizing
special saturation functions, the given constraints in the inputs
and states can be systematically incorporated in the overall design
process. In order to capture model uncertainties and external disturbance,
an optimal state feedback controller is designed on the basis of
the model linearization along the desired trajectories. The proposed
control scheme is implemented in a real-time environment, and the
feasibility and the excellent performance are demonstrated by means
of experimental results.

	Abstract = {Current approaches for visual-inertial odometry (VIO) are able to attain highly accurate state estimation via nonlinear optimization. However, real-time optimization quickly becomes infeasible as the trajectory grows over time; this problem is further emphasized by the fact that inertial measurements come at high rate, hence leading to fast growth of the number of variables in the optimization. In this paper, we address this issue by preintegrating inertial measurements between selected keyframes into single relative motion constraints. Our first contribution is a preintegration theory that properly addresses the manifold structure of the rotation group. We formally discuss the generative measurement model as well as the nature of the rotation noise and derive the expression for the maximum a posteriori state estimator. Our theoretical development enables the computation of all necessary Jacobians for the optimization and a-posteriori bias correction in analytic form. The second contribution is to show that the preintegrated IMU model can be seamlessly integrated into a visual-inertial pipeline under the unifying framework of factor graphs. This enables the application of incremental-smoothing algorithms and the use of a structureless model for visual measurements, which avoids optimizing over the 3D points, further accelerating the computation. We perform an extensive evaluation of our monocular VIO pipeline on real and simulated datasets. The results confirm that our modelling effort leads to accurate state estimation in real-time, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.

	Abstract = {Identification concerning different types of radar targets can be achieved by using various radar signatures, such as one-dimensional (1-D) range profiles, 2-D radar images, and 1-D or 2-D scattering centres on a target. To solve the target identification problem, the authors utilise 1-D scattering centres, which correspond to the highest peaks in the 1-D range profile. The proposed approach obtains scale and translational-invariant features based on the central moments from the distribution of the 1-D scattering centres on the target; these 1-D scattering centres can be extracted from various techniques such as inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT), fast root-multiple signal classification (fast root-MUSIC), total least squares-Prony (TLS-Prony), generalised eigenvalues utilising signal subspace eigenvectors (GEESE), and the matrix-pencil (MP) algorithm. The information redundancy contained in these features, as well as their dimensions, are further reduced via the Karhunen--Loeve transform, followed by adequate scaling of the computed central moments. The resulting small dimensional and redundancy-free feature vectors are classified using the Bayes classifier. Finally, this new strategy for radar-target identification is demonstrated with data measured in the compact range facility, and the above five different techniques for 1-D scattering centre extraction are compared and investigated in the context of target identification},

This paper evaluates several refinement methods which minimise functions of Sampson's error. All perform well on large sets of correspondences or when inlier rates are high, but many perform poorly or fail when the inlier set found by RANSAC is small; this is shown to be because the inlier sets contain remaining outliers, while missing some inliers. The most accurate solutions are given by minimising the robust Blake-Zisserman function of Sampson's error, although this provides only a minimal improvement in accuracy compared with least squares refinement. The most reliable results are given by nonlinear optimisation constrained to the essential manifold. An efficient parametrisation of the essential manifold as a quaternion and a unit vector is described; applying Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares combined with Levenberg-Marquardt optimisation on this manifold takes typically less than one millisecond.},

is to follow a certain geometric path and then to satisfy dynamic
constraints in another step. The approach is to introduce a virtual
leader that resides on the desired geometric path and to move the
leader to the closest position to the vehicle, so that it converges
quickly. The leader is then manuevered to satisfy the dynamic constraints.

for detection and tracking of airborne obstacles in cluttered

using the image homography obtained from the image sequence

approaching in short range by using the probabilistic

multi-hypothesis tracking (PMHT) method. The proposed

algorithm is suitable especially when it needed to perform

missions for real flight application such as reconnaissance and

surveillance at low altitude as it is less sensitive to light

conditions or color variations. The performance of the proposed

algorithm is validated by applying to the onboard video clips

taken during flight test and actual flight test in real world.},

Holonomic and Nonholonomic Constraints, Variational approach, free
flying, kinematic redundancy. Comments: Robotic manipulators will
play a significant role in the maintenance and repair of space stations
and satellites, and other future space missions. Robot path planning
and control for the above applications should be optimum, since any
inefficiency in the planning may considerably risk the success of
the space mission. This paper presents a global optimum path planning
scheme for redundant space robotic manipulators to be used in such
missions. In this formulation, a variational approach is used to
minimize the objective functional. It is assumed that the gravity
is zero in space, and the robotic manipulator is mounted on a completely
free-flying base and the attitude control is off. Linear and angular
monentum conditions for this system lead to a set of mixed holonomic
and nonholonomic constraints. These equations are adjoined to the
objective functional using a Lagrange multiplier technique. The formulation
leads to a system of Differential and Algebraic Equations. A numerical
scheme for forward integration of this system is presented. A planar
redundant space manipulator consisting of three arms and a base is
considered to demonstrate the feasibility of the formulation. The
approach to optimum path planning of redundant space robots is significant
since most robots that have been developed for space applications
so far are redundant. The kinematic redundancy of space robots offers
efficient control and provides the necessary dexterity for extra-vehicular
activity that exheeds human capacity. },

	Abstract = {Abstract---Collision detection and estimation from a monocular visual
sensor is an important enabling technology for safe navigation of
small or micro air vehicles in near earth flight. In this paper,
we introduce a new approach called expansion segmentation, which
simultaneously detects ``collision danger regions'' of significant
positive divergence in inertial aided video, and estimates maximum
likelihood time to collision (TTC) in a correspondenceless framework
within the danger regions. This approach was motivated from a literature
review which showed that existing approaches make strong assumptions
about scene structure or camera motion, or pose collision detection
without determining obstacle boundaries, both of which limit the
operational envelope of a deployable system. Expansion segmentation
is based on a new formulation of 6- DOF inertial aided TTC estimation,
and a new derivation of a first order TTC uncertainty model due to
subpixel quantization error and epipolar geometry uncertainty. Proof
of concept results are shown in a custom designed urban flight simulator
and on operational flight data from a small air vehicle.},

	Abstract = {This paper reports on a generic factor-based method for node removal in factor-graph simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), which we call generic linear constraints (GLCs). The need for a generic node removal tool is motivated by long-term SLAM applications, whereby nodes are removed in order to control the computational cost of graph optimization. GLC is able to produce a new set of linearized factors over the elimination clique that can represent either the true marginalization (i.e., dense GLC) or a sparse approximation of the true marginalization using a Chow-Liu tree (i.e., sparse GLC). The proposed algorithm improves upon commonly used methods in two key ways: First, it is not limited to graphs with strictly full-state relative-pose factors and works equally well with other low-rank factors, such as those produced by monocular vision. Second, the new factors are produced in such a way that accounts for measurement correlation, which is a problem encountered in other methods that rely strictly upon pairwise measurement composition. We evaluate the proposed method over multiple real-world SLAM graphs and show that it outperforms other recently proposed methods in terms of Kullback--Leibler divergence. Additionally, we experimentally demonstrate that the proposed GLC method provides a principled and flexible tool to control the computational complexity of long-term graph SLAM, with results shown for {\$}34.9, rm h{\$} of real-world indoor--outdoor data covering {\$}147.4hbox km{\$} collected over {\$}27{\$} mapping sessions spanning a period of {\$}15{\$} months.},

	Abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015, MIT Press Journals. All rights reserved. Recent results in monocular visual-inertial navigation (VIN) have shown that optimization-based approaches outperform filtering methods in terms of accuracy due to their capability to relinearize past states. However, the improvement comes at the cost of increased computational complexity. In this paper, we address this issue by preintegrating inertial measurements between selected keyframes. The preintegration allows us to accurately summarize hundreds of inertial measurements into a single relative motion constraint. Our first contribution is a preintegration theory that properly addresses the manifold structure of the rotation group and carefully deals with uncertainty propagation. The measurements are integrated in a local frame, which eliminates the need to repeat the integration when the linearization point changes while leaving the opportunity for belated bias corrections. The second contribution is to show that the preintegrated IMU model can be seamlessly integrated in a visual-inertial pipeline under the unifying framework of factor graphs. This enables the use of a structureless model for visual measurements, further accelerating the computation. The third contribution is an extensive evaluation of our monocular VIN pipeline: experimental results confirm that our system is very fast and demonstrates superior accuracy with respect to competitive state-of-the-art filtering and optimization algorithms, including off-the-shelf systems such as Google Tango [1].},

The object is represented by a set of viewpoint invariant region descriptors so that recognition can proceed successfully despite changes in viewpoint, illumination and partial occlusion. The temporal continuity of the video within a shot is used to track the regions in order to reject those that are unstable. Efficient retrieval is achieved by employing methods from statistical text retrieval, including inverted file systems, and text and document frequency weightings. This requires a visual analogy of a word which is provided here by vector quantizing the region descriptors. The final ranking also depends on the spatial layout of the regions. The result is that retrieval is immediate, returning a ranked list of shots in the manner of Google. We report results for object retrieval on the full length feature films 'Groundhog Day', 'Casablanca' and 'Run Lola Run', including searches from within the movie and specified by external images downloaded from the Internet. We investigate retrieval performance with respect to different quantizations of region descriptors and compare the performance of several ranking measures.

	Abstract = {We present a novel solution to the camera pose estimation problem, where rotation and translation of a camera between two views are estimated from matched feature points in the images. The camera pose estimation problem is traditionally solved via algorithms that are based on the essential matrix or the Euclidean homography. With six or more feature points in general positions in the space, essential matrix based algorithms can recover a unique solution. However, such algorithms fail when points are on critical surfaces (e.g., coplanar points) and homography should be used instead. By formulating the problem in quaternions and decoupling the rotation and translation estimation, our proposed algorithm works for all point configurations. Using both simulated and real world images, we compare the estimation accuracy of our algorithm with some of the most commonly used algorithms. Our method is shown to be more robust to noise and outliers. For the benefit of community, we have made the implementation of our algorithm available online and free.},

biases, non-unit scale factors, axis misalignments and cross-axis
sensitivities of both the tri-axial accelerometer and gyroscopic

of gyroscopes is significantly improved by comparing the outputs
ofthe accelerometer and the IMU orientation integration algorithm
after arbitrary motions. The derived property and proposed cost function
allow the gyroscopes to be calibrated without external equipment,
such as a turntable, or requirint precise maneuvers. Both factors
allow the IMU to be easily calibrated by a user in the field so that
it can function as an accurate orientation sensor. A custom-made
prototype IMU is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
methods, with data that are carefully obtained using prescribed motions,
as well as those less rigorously colleced from the IMU when it is
mounted on the head of a user or held in hands with brief random
movements. With calibration, the observed average static angular
error is less than a quarter of a degree and the dynamic angular
error is reduced by a factor of 2 to 5.},

The problem requires estimating the relative pose between the vehicles. We assume that onboard inertial measurement units can provide roll and pitch estimates of the aircraft attitude. We examine the observability of other relative states needed to do the handoff problem. In particular, we consider two different scenarios. In the first scenario, we assume that the relative position between the aircrafts is measured, as would be the case for a radar or a lidar sensor. We assume that the two aircrafts do not exchange their airspeed and turn rate information. Under mild assumptions, we show that the relative heading between the two aircrafts is observable. In the second scenario, we assume that only the bearing angle between the two aircrafts is measured, as would be the case for a vision sensor. We prove state observability for maneuvers that are relevant to target tracking and handoff. We also present an estimation algorithm that uses a bank of extended Kalman filters to estimate the relative states. Simulation results with full vehicle dynamics demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach.},

These hidden Markov models are then used to solve the data association problem in the presence of clutter and missed detections for multitarget tracking using a Rao--Blackwellized particle filter. The proposed hidden Markov model tracking approach permits easy generation of accurate probabilistic models from a priori road network structure information, and it naturally enables sparse computationally efficient handling of multimodal target state uncertainties using both positive and negative unattended ground sensor information.

	Abstract = {Recursive estimation of nonlinear dynamical systems is an important problem that arises in several engineering applications. Consistent and accurate propagation of uncertainties is important to ensuring good estimation performance. It is well known that the posterior state estimates in nonlinear problems may assume non-Gaussian multimodal densities. In the past, Gaussian mixture filters and particle filters were introduced to handle non-Gaussianity and nonlinearity. However, these methods have seen only limited success as most mixture filters attempt to fix the number of mixture modes during estimation process, and the particle filters suffer from the curse of dimensionality. In this paper, we propose a particle based Gaussian mixture filtering approach for the general nonlinear estimation problem that is free of the particle depletion problem inherent to most particle filters. We employ an ensemble of randomly sampled states for the propagation of state probability density. A Gaussian mixture model of the propagated uncertainty is then recovered by clustering the ensemble. The posterior density is obtained subsequently through a Kalman measurement update of the mixture modes. We prove the weak convergence of the PGM density to the true filter density assuming exponential forgetting of initial conditions by the true filter. The estimation performance of the proposed filtering approach is demonstrated through several test cases.},

	Abstract = {This paper considers the problem of tracking multiple moving targets on a road network with sparse, highly
localized, unattended ground sensor data that are subject to clutter and missed detections. Hidden Markov models for
single-target localization with unattended ground sensor data are first derived for road networks, under the
assumption of perfect data association. These hidden Markov models are then used to solve the data association
problem in the presence of clutter and missed detections for multitarget tracking using a Rao--Blackwellized particle
filter. The proposed hidden Markov model tracking approach permits easy generation of accurate probabilistic
models from a priori road network structure information, and it naturally enables sparse computationally efficient
handling of multimodal target state uncertainties using both positive and negative unattended ground sensor
information. The Rao--Blackwellized particle filter provides a fully Bayesian solution to the data association problem,
enabling exploration of the association hypotheses space that leverages the computational advantages of exact hidden
Markov model inference for multimodal state estimation. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the
hidden Markov model/Rao--Blackwellized particle filter on challenging multitarget tracking scenarios with high
false-alarm and missed detection rates.},

The road network model is nice. It seems like we should be able to use a similar model for the MASS project. We will need different sensor models. The method is similar to Peter's histogram filter approach.

	Abstract = {THE objective of this Note is to present an elegant solution to

a nonlinear estimation scheme that allows the development

of accurate and robust system estimates in the presence of nonlinearities,

noise, and faults, in real time. Traditional state estimation

for linear systems has a rich, elegant theory, namely, the stochastic

Kalman filter. Extension of Kalman filtering theory, especially

guarantees, to nonlinear systems is nontrivial. The extended Kalman

filter (EKF) (see Ref. 1) is an approximate extension of Kalman

filtering techniques to nonlinear systems by linearizing the state

dynamics at each time step. The EKF does not require linearity,

stability, or time invariance of the system; it does require that
the

state dynamics are sufficiently differentiable, that is, the Jacobian

exists. Although the EKF is quite flexible and well used in applications

such as radar tracking and global positioning systems,

disadvantages include sensitivities to required a priori information

(initial state and noise environment), which can lead to bias and
even

divergence.2},

	Abstract = {Goats have always been considered very useful animals. Goats success is related to its excellent adaptability to the diicult mountain conditions, extreme weather and low value feed acceptance, versatile habits and high production considering their size. These are some reasons because goats are among the irst animals to be domesticated. In terms of evolution, goats could be separated by their dispersion area in three large groups: the European, the Asian, and the African. Global goat populations, mainly in Africa and in Asia, have increased for centuries but very strongly in the past decades, well above the world population growth. They are also used for forest grazing, an integrated and alter- native production system, very useful to control weed growth reducing ire risk. Despite some exceptions, no large‐scale efort to professionalize this industry has been made so far. There are consumers for goat dairy products and there is enough global production, but misses a professional network between both. Regarding goat meat, the world leader- ship also stays in Africa and Asia, namely in China, and there is a new phenomenon, the spreading of goat meat tradition through Europe due to migrants from Africa and other places with strong goat meat consumption.},

There is a brief introduction to basic plotting functions in R, followed by a description of the organisation of R graphics into coherent and consistent sets of graphics functions, plus an indication of what sorts of plots each set of functions can produce. There is also a brief discussion of the limitations of R graphics. One of the features that draws many users to R1 is the graphics sub-system. The main features that distinguish R from the many other software systems that can be used to produce plots are that R provides facilities for creating a very wide range of statistical plots, R allows for very fine control over the appearance of plots, and R produces plots that are suitable for professional publication. This article provides an overview of the basic features of R graphics, along with some simple examples of how to produce plots using R. The general structure and organisation of R graphics is also described to give the reader some indication of how to explore R graphics system further. While some graphical user interfaces exist for R, and some of these provide menu items for producing plots, the only way to make use of the full power of the R graphics system is to write R code, so this article will only address the R code that can be used to produce plots},

The proposed planner follows a two--step, receding horizon, belief space--based approach. At first, in an online computed tree the algorithm finds the branch that optimizes the amount of space expected to be explored. The first viewpoint configuration of this branch is selected, but the path towards it is decided through a second planning step. Within that, a new tree is sampled, admissible branches arriving at the reference viewpoint are found and the robot belief about its state and the tracked landmarks of the environment is propagated. The branch that minimizes the expected localization and mapping uncertainty is selected, the corresponding path is executed by the robot and the whole process is iteratively repeated. The proposed planner is capable of running online onboard a small aerial robot and its performance is evaluated using experimental studies in a challenging environment.},

	Abstract = {During last decade the scientific research on Unmanned Aerial Vehicless (UAVs) increased spectacularly and led to the design of multiple types of aerial platforms. The major challenge today is the development of autonomously operating aerial agents capable of completing missions independently of human interaction. To this extent, visual sens-ing techniques have been integrated in the control pipeline of the UAVs in order to enhance their nav-igation and guidance skills. The aim of this article is to present a comprehensive literature review on vision based applications for UAVs focusing mainly on current developments and trends. These applica-tions are sorted in different categories according to the research topics among various research groups. More specifically vision based position-attitude con-trol, pose estimation and mapping, obstacle detection as well as target tracking are the identified compo-nents towards autonomous agents. Aerial platforms could reach greater level of autonomy by integrating all these technologies onboard. Additionally, through-out this article the concept of fusion multiple sensors is highlighted, while an overview on the challenges},

The observer operates under a persistent excitation constraint and requires the inertial origin to remain in view throughout its operation. The contributions of this paper are an iterative procedure to increase convergence speed of nonlinear observers and a process for keeping the inertial origin within view.

	Abstract = { Johnny Evers vision of how biology should help in MAV airframe design,
and navigation, guidance, and control.

The ease with which flying insects, birds and bats negotiate confined,
obstacle-cluttered airspace has long inspired us with visions of
human-designed aerial machines with similar performance. Flying animals
exhibit capabilities for aerial acrobatics, insensitivity to wind
gusts, avoiding collision with or intercepting fixed and moving objects,
landing and take off from small perches, and numerous other feats
of flight agility that are beyond those of human-engineered vehicles.
Although we are naturally tempted to look to biological organisms
for inspiration or as design templates, the performance of the resulting
bio-inspired or biomimetic engineered devices rarely approaches that
of the living organisms. Among several possible reasons for this,
two important issues motivate and provide a focus for this paper:
it is nearly impossible to correlate biological processes with engineering
design principles; biological systems possess sensing-computationactuation
response architectures and processes that appear to differ from those
of engineered systems in fundamental ways, those differences are
poorly understood and their importance little appreciated. These
issues provide rich opportunities for research to produce genuine
advancements in our understanding of biological and artificial autonomy.
The research will necessarily involve biologists, engineers, and
mathematicians. As with any research endeavor involving multiple
mature disciplines, long term research collaborations are necessary
for establishing the foundation of fundamentally new science. Unfortunately,
without an objective understanding of these two issues and their
implications for guiding autonomous air vehicle research and development,
the real promise for biology-inspired or biomimetic concepts to achieve
breakthroughs in vehicle capabilities may remain an elusive dream.

For many MAV applications a robust navigation solution requires responding quickly to obstacles in dynamic, tight environments with non- negligible disturbances. This article first outlines the Reac- tive Obstacle Avoidance Plugin framework as a method for leveraging map-based algorithms while providing low-latency, high-bandwidth response to obstacles. Further, we propose and demonstrate the effectiveness of the Cushioned Extended- Periphery Avoidance (CEPA) algorithm. By representing recent laser scans in the current body-fixed polar coordinate frame, a 360○ lower-bound understanding of the environment is available. With this extended field of view, motion assump- tions common in other reactive planners can be relaxed and emergency control effort can be applied in any direction. CEPA is validated in simulation and on hardware in a GPS-denied environment using strictly onboard computation and sensing.},

	Abstract = {Abstract---This paper considers the problem of obtaining good

attitude estimates from measurements obtained from typical low

cost inertial measurement units. The outputs of such systems are

characterized by high noise levels and time varying additive biases.

We formulate the filtering problem as deterministic observer

kinematics posed directly on the special orthogonal group SO(3)

driven by reconstructed attitude and angular velocity measurements.

Lyapunov analysis results for the proposed observers are

derived that ensure almost global stability of the observer error.

The approach taken leads to an observer that we term the direct

complementary filter. By exploiting the geometry of the special orthogonal

group a related observer, termed the passive complementary

filter, is derived that decouples the gyro measurements from

the reconstructed attitude in the observer inputs. Both the direct

and passive filters can be extended to estimate gyro bias online.
The

passive filter is further developed to provide a formulation in terms

of the measurement error that avoids any algebraic reconstruction

of the attitude. This leads to an observer on SO(3), termed the

explicit complementary filter, that requires only accelerometer and

gyro outputs; is suitable for implementation on embedded hardware;

and provides good attitude estimates as well as estimating the

gyro biases online. The performance of the observers are demonstrated

with a set of experiments performed on a robotic test-bed

and a radio controlled unmanned aerial vehicle.},

	Abstract = {Abstract?We present a new parametrization for point features

within monocular simultaneous localization and mapping

(SLAM) that permits efficient and accurate representation of uncertainty

during undelayed initialization and beyond, all within

the standard extended Kalman filter (EKF). The key concept

is direct parametrization of the inverse depth of features relative

to the camera locations from which they were first viewed,

which produces measurement equations with a high degree of

linearity. Importantly, our parametrization can cope with features

over a huge range of depths, even those that are so far fromthe camera

that they present little parallax during motion?maintaining

sufficient representative uncertainty that these points retain the
opportunity

to ?come in? smoothly from infinity if the camera makes

larger movements. Feature initialization is undelayed in the sense

that even distant features are immediately used to improve camera

motion estimates, acting initially as bearing references but not

permanently labeled as such. The inverse depth parametrization

remains well behaved for features at all stages of SLAM processing,

but has the drawback in computational terms that each point is

represented by a 6-D state vector as opposed to the standard three

of a Euclidean XYZ representation. We show that once the depth

estimate of a feature is sufficiently accurate, its representation
can

safely be converted to the Euclidean XYZ form, and propose a

linearity index that allows automatic detection and conversion to

maintain maximum efficiency?only low parallax features need be

maintained in inverse depth form for long periods. We present a

real-time implementation at 30 Hz, where the parametrization is

validated in a fully automatic 3-D SLAM system featuring a handheld

single camera with no additional sensing. Experiments show

robust operation in challenging indoor and outdoor environments

with a very large ranges of scene depth, varied motion, and also

real time 360? loop closing.},

	Abstract = {The RANSAC framework is often used to estimate the relative pose of two cameras from outlier-contaminated point correspondences, via the essential matrix, however this is computationally expensive due the cost of computing essential matrices from many sets of five to seven correspondences. The leading contemporary 5-point solver (Nister, 2004) is slow because of the expensive linear algebra decompositions and polynomial solve which are required. To avoid these costs we propose to use Levenberg-Marquardt optimisation on a manifold to find a subset of the compatible essential matrices. The proposed algorithm finds essential matrices at a higher rate than closed-form approaches, and reduces the time needed to find relative poses using RANSAC by 25{\%}. The second contribution of this paper is to apply the optimisations used in 5-point solvers to the classic 7-point algorithm. RANSAC using the optimised 7-point algorithm is considerably faster than 5-point RANSAC (unless planar point configurations are common), despite the increased number of iterations necessary. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

use of the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) as it applies to spacecraft
attitude estimation. The application of the UKF is clearly explained.
Quaternions are used to represent the attitude of the spacecraft.
The paper explains that straightforward application of the UKF results
in measurement update equations that violate the unit norm constraint
of the unit quaternion. As an alternative the attitude error is converted
to an attitude representation that looks like a modified Rodrigues
parameterization. The measurement update is performed with these
parameters and then converted back into quaternion representation
for the time update law. Simulation results indicate that for large
initial attitude error, the UKF performs significantly better than
the EKF. },

Recently, the novel random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithm shows a good tracking performance in dense clutter environment. However, the heavy computational burden limits the usage for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). In this paper, a density-based recursive random sample consensus (DBR-RANSAC) algorithm is proposed, which utilizes the density property of measurements within several steps to direct sampling. In the DBR-RANSAC, the randomness of sampling can be avoided and the computation complexity can be reduced particularly in dense clutter. The simulation results show the validity of the proposed algorithm.},

	Abstract = {This paper deals with the construction of nonlinear observers for navigation purposes. We first present a globally exponentially stable observer for attitude and gyro bias, based on gyro measurements and two or more pairs of vector measurements. We avoid the well-known topological obstructions to global stability by not confining the attitude estimate to SO(3), but rather estimating a full rotation matrix with nine degrees of freedom. We also show how the attitude can be estimated under a relaxed persistency-of-excitation condition, with a single vector measurement as a special case. Next, we use the attitude observer to construct a globally exponentially stable observer for gnss/ins integration, based on accelerometer, gyro, and magnetometer measurements, as well as gnss measurements of position and (optionally) velocity. We verify the stability properties of the design using experimental data from a light fixed-wing aircraft.},

This paper demonstrates another example of being able to design a

The control will, of course, be suboptimal, with no real indication
of optimality. Simulation results presented in this paper are very
nice and show that nonlinear H-infinity control has merit. The synthesized
control law also turns out to be linear. It would be interesting
to use our software to see if better results can be obtained using

In addition, it would be fairly simple to get experimental results.

	Abstract = {In this article, efficient computational models for ship motions are presented. These models are used to simulate ship movements in real time. Compared with traditional approaches, our method possesses the ability to cope with different ship shapes, engines, and sea conditions without the loss of efficiency. Based on our models, we create a ship motion simulation system for both entertainment and educational applications. Our system assists users to learn the motions of a ship encountering waves, currents, and winds. Users can adjust engine powers, rudders, and other ship facilities via a graphical user interface to create their own ship models. They can also change the environment by altering wave frequencies, wave amplitudes, wave directions, currents, and winds. Therefore, numerous combinations of ships and the environment are generated and the learning becomes more amusing. In our system, a ship is treated as a rigid body floating on the sea surface. Its motions compose of 6 degrees of freedom: pitch, heave, roll, surge, sway, and yaw. These motions are divided into two categories. The first three movements are induced by sea waves, and the last three ones are caused by propellers, rudders, currents, and winds. Based on Newton's laws and other basic physics motion models, we deduce algorithms to compute the magnitudes of the motions. Our methods can be carried out in real time and possess high fidelity. According to ship theory, the net effects of external forces on the ship hull depend on the ship shape. Therefore, the behaviors of the ship are influenced by its shape. To enhance our physics models, we classify ships into three basic types. They are flat ships, thin ships, and slender ships. Each type of ship is associated with some predefined parameters to specify their characteristics. Users can tune ship behaviors by varying the parameters even though they have only a little knowledge of ship theory. Springer-Verlag London Limited 2008.},

Existing robust SLAM methods assume a good initialization or an " odometry back-bone " to classify inlier and outlier loop closures. In the multi-robot case, these assumptions do not always hold. This paper presents an algorithm called Pairwise Consistency Max-imization (PCM) that estimates the largest pairwise internally consistent set of measurements. Finding the largest pairwise internally consistent set can be transformed into an instance of the maximum clique problem from graph theory, and by leveraging the associated literature it can be solved in real-time. This paper evaluates how well PCM approximates the combinatorial gold standard using simulated data. It also evaluates the performance of PCM on synthetic and real-world data sets in comparison with DCS, SCGP, and RANSAC, and shows that PCM significantly outperforms these methods.},

	Abstract = {The multitarget recursive Bayes nonlinear filter is the theoretically optimal approach to multisensor-multitarget detection, tracking, and identification. For applications in which this filter is appropriate, it is likely to be tractable for only a small number of targets. In earlier papers we derived closed-form equations for an approximation of this filter based on propagation of a first-order multitarget moment called the probability hypothesis density (PHD). In a recent paper, Erdinc, Willett, and Bar-Shalom argued for the need for a PHD-type filter which remains first-order in the states of individual targets, but which is higher-order in target number. In this paper we show that this is indeed possible. We derive a closed-form cardinalized PHD (CPHD) filter, which propagates not only the PHD but also the entire probability distribution on target number.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cytomegalovirus, otherwise called human herpes virus type 5, is a transfusion transmissible pathogen responsible for significant morbidity and mortality among various groups of individuals with damaged or impaired host immunity. Although it has a worldwide distribution, the infection is thought to be more widespread in developing countries where certain demographic factors and living conditions are thought to be responsible for the observed increased prevalence of this infection. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of living conditions, using certain selected demographic parameters, on CMV seropositivity, among blood donors in Jos. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 200 prospective blood donors who presented for bleeding were recruited consecutively into the study. Questionnaire was used to obtain the personal, educational, social and demographic data of donors. Screening for CMV antibodies was performed on each serum sample using ELISA kit ("DIALAB", Austria) (www.dialab.at). RESULTS: The relationship between the extent of crowding and CMV status of donors was statistically significant, p{\textless}0.05. Other studied donor demographic parameters (source of drinking water, place of abode and type of toilet facility) did not statistically influence donor CMV status, p{\textgreater}0.05. CONCLUSION: Our study showed that overcrowding was the most significant factor that statistically influenced donor CMV status in Jos, Nigeria. There is, therefore, an urgent need for concerted effort to handle the problem of overcrowding in developing countries and Nigeria in particular.},

	Abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Springer Science+Business Media B.V. This paper presents the design of a complete control system for the autonomous landing of unmanned flybarless helicopters on known stationary visual landmarks. A state estimator based on the complementary filters notion, estimates the position, translational velocity and attitude vectors of the vehicle by fusing data acquired from the on--board camera and an Inertial Measurement Unit. A vision-aided nonlinear model predictive controller is designed for the landing motion of the helicopter, assuming that the on--board camera is rigidly (i.e., no additional Degrees of Freedom (DOF)) attached on the vehicle. Although the under--actuated character of the helicopter dynamics introduces counter--goals for minimizing the error between the vehicle and the landmark, the proposed control scheme guarantees, via hard nonlinear constraints, that the landmark will always be kept inside the camera field of view during the landing procedure. In order to simplify the derived algorithm without violating the robustness of the proposed controller, we reformulate the translational helicopter dynamics in order to reduce the number of the unknown model parameters to a minimum.

The aim of this document is to propose a newmethod for solving the homography decomposition problem. This newmethod provides analytical expressions for the solutions of the problem, instead of the traditional numerical procedures. As a result, expressions of the translation vector, rotation matrix and object-plane normal are explicitly expressed as a function of the entries of the homography matrix. The main advantage of this method is that it will provide a deeper understanding on the homography decomposition problem. For instance, it allows to obtain the relations among the possible solutions of the problem. Thus, new vision-based robot control laws can be designed. For example the control schemes proposed in this report combine the two final solutions of the problem (only one of them being the true one) assuming that there is no a priori knowledge for discerning among them.},

	Abstract = {Abstract--- Sampling-based optimal planners, such as RRT*, almost-surely converge asymptotically to the optimal solution, but have provably slow convergence rates in high dimensions. This is because their commitment to finding the global optimum compels them to prioritize exploration of the entire problem domain even as its size grows exponentially. Optimization techniques, such as CHOMP, have fast convergence on these problems but only to local optima. This is because they are exploitative, prioritizing the immediate improvement of a path even though this may not find the global optimum of nonconvex cost functions.

In this paper, we present a hybrid technique that integrates the benefits of both methods into a single search. A key insight is that applying local optimization to a subset of edges likely to improve the solution avoids the prohibitive cost of optimizing every edge in a global search. This is made possible by Batch Informed Trees (BIT*), an informed global technique that orders its search by potential solution quality. In our algorithm, Regionally Accelerated BIT* (RABIT*), we extend BIT* by using optimization to exploit local domain information and find alternative connections for edges in collision and accelerate the search. This improves search performance in problems with difficult-to-sample homotopy classes (e.g., narrow passages) while maintaining almost-sure asymptotic convergence to the global optimum.

Our experiments on simulated random worlds and real data from an autonomous helicopter show that on certain difficult problems, RABIT* converges 1.8 times faster than BIT*. Qualitatively, in problems with difficult-to-sample homotopy classes, we show that RABIT* is able to efficiently transform paths to avoid obstacles.},

We pose the problem of finding the best vertex positional configuration in the presence of an additional proximity constraint, in the sense that, the second smallest eigenvalue of the corresponding graph Laplacian is maximized. In many recent applications of algebraic graph theory in systems and control, the second smallest eigenvalue of Laplacian has emerged as a critical parameter that influences the stability and robustness properties of dynamic systems that operate over an information network. Our motivation in the present work is to "assign" this Laplacian eigenvalue when relative positions of various elements dictate the interconnection of the underlying weighted graph.

	Abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE. Despite the recent flight control regulations, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are still gaining popularity in civilian and military applications, as much as for personal use. Such emerging interest is pushing the development of effective collision avoidance systems. Such systems play a critical role UAVs operations especially in a crowded airspace setting. Because of cost and weight limitations associated with UAVs payload, camera based technologies are the de-facto choice for collision avoidance navigation systems. This requires multitarget detection and tracking algorithms from a video, which can be run on board efficiently. While there has been a great deal of research on object detection and tracking from a stationary camera, few have attempted to detect and track small UAVs from a moving camera. In this paper, we present a new approach to detect and track UAVs from a single camera mounted on a different UAV. Initially, we estimate background motions via a perspective transformation model and then identify distinctive points in the background subtracted image. We find spatio-temporal traits of each moving object through optical flow matching and then classify those candidate targets based on their motion patterns compared with the background. The performance is boosted through Kalman filter tracking. This results in temporal consistency among the candidate detections. The algorithm was validated on video datasets taken from a UAV.

	Abstract = {The displacement of a calibrated camera between two images of a planar object can be estimated by decomposing a homography matrix. The aim of this document is to propose a newmethod for solving the homography decomposition problem. This newmethod provides analytical expressions for the solutions of the problem, instead of the traditional numerical procedures. As a result, expressions of the translation vector, rotation matrix and object-plane normal are explicitly expressed as a function of the entries of the homography matrix. The main advantage of this method is that it will provide a deeper understanding on the homography decomposition problem. For instance, it allows to obtain the relations among the possible solutions of the problem. Thus, new vision-based robot control laws can be designed. For example the control schemes proposed in this report combine the two final solutions of the problem (only one of them being the true one) assuming that there is no a priori knowledge for discerning among them.},

Guidance, navigation and motion control systems for autonomous vehicles are increasingly important in land-based, marine and aerial operations. Autonomous underwater vehicles may be used for pipeline inspection, light intervention work, underwater survey and collection of oceanographic/biological data. Autonomous unmanned aerial systems can be used in a large number of applications such as inspection, monitoring, data collection, surveillance, etc. At present, vehicles operate with limited autonomy and a minimum of intelligence. There is a growing interest for cooperative and coordinated multi-vehicle systems, real-time re-planning, robust autonomous navigation systems and robust autonomous control of vehicles. Unmanned vehicles with high levels of autonomy may be used for safe and efficient collection of environmental data, for assimilation of climate and environmental models and to complement global satellite systems. The target audience primarily comprises research experts in the field of control theory, but the book may also be beneficial for graduate students.

Specifically, we use image-based visual servoing (IBVS) to track the platform in two-dimensional image space and generate a velocity reference command used as the input to an adaptive sliding mode controller. Compared with other vision-based control algorithms that reconstruct a full three-dimensional representation of the target, which requires precise depth estimation, IBVS is computationally cheaper since it is less sensitive to the depth estimation allowing for a faster method to obtain this estimate. To enhance velocity tracking of the sliding mode controller, an adaptive rule is described to account for the ground effect experienced during the maneuver. Finally, the IBVS algorithm integrated with the adaptive sliding mode controller for tracking and landing is validated in an experimental setup using a quadrotor.},

@article{HamelSamson18,
	Abstract = {This paper revisits the problem of estimating the pose (position and orientation) of a body in 3-D space with respect to (w.r.t.) an inertial frame by using 1) the knowledge of source points positions in the inertial frame, 2) the measurements of the body angular velocity expressed in the body's frame, 3) the measurements of the body translational velocity, either in the body frame or in the inertial frame, and 4) source points bearing measurements performed in the body frame. An important difference with the much studied static Perspective-n-Point problem addressed with iterative algorithms is that body motion is not only allowed but also used as a source of information that improves the estimation possibilities. With respect to the probabilistic framework commonly used in other studies that develop extended Kalman filter solutions, the deterministic approach here adopted is better suited to point out the observability conditions, that involve the number and disposition of the source points in combination with bodymotion characteristics, under which the proposed observers ensure robust estimation of the body pose. These observers are here named Riccati observers because of the instrumental role played by the continuous Riccati equation in the design of the observers and in the Lyapunov stability and convergence analysis that we develop independently of the well-known complementary (either deterministic or probabilistic) optimality properties associated with Kalman filtering. The set of these observers also encompasses extended Kalman filter solutions. Another contribution of this study is to show the importance of using body motion to improve the observers performance and, when this is possible, of measuring the body translational velocity in the inertial frame rather than in the body frame to allow for the body pose estimation from a single source point taken as the origin of the inertial frame. This latter possibility finds a natural extension in the Simultaneous Localisation And Mapping (SLAM) problem in Robotics.},

	Abstract = {Abstract--The Hough transform is a method for "~.~tectingcurves by exploiting the duality between points on a curve and parameters of that curve. The initial work showed how to detect both analytic curves(1'2) and non-analytic curves,(3)but these methods were restricted to binary edge images.This work was generalizedto the detection of some analytic curves in grey levelimages,specificallylines,14)circles15)and parabolas/6) The line detection case is the best known of these and has been ingeniouslyexploited in severalapplications/7'89) We show how the boundaries of an arbitrary non-analytic shape can be used to construct a mapping betweenimage space and Hough transform space. Such a mapping can be exploited to detect instances of that particular shape in an image. Furthermore, variations in the shape such as rotations, scale changes or figure-ground reversals correspond to straightforward transformations of this mapping. However, the most remarkable property is that such mappings can be composed to build mappings for complex shapes from the mappings of simpler component shapes. This makes the generalized Hough transform a kind of universal transform which can be used to find arbitrarily complex shapes.},

	Abstract = {Abstract---Recent results in monocular visual-inertial navigation
(VIN) have shown that optimization-based approaches
outperform filtering methods in terms of accuracy due to their
capability to relinearize past states. However, the improvement
comes at the cost of increased computational complexity. In this
paper, we address this issue by preintegrating inertial measurements
between selected keyframes. The preintegration allows us
to accurately summarize hundreds of inertial measurements into
a single relative motion constraint. Our first contribution is a
preintegration theory that properly addresses the manifold structure
of the rotation group and carefully deals with uncertainty
propagation. The measurements are integrated in a local frame,
which eliminates the need to repeat the integration when the
linearization point changes while leaving the opportunity for
belated bias corrections. The second contribution is to show that
the preintegrated IMU model can be seamlessly integrated in a
visual-inertial pipeline under the unifying framework of factor
graphs. This enables the use of a structureless model for visual
measurements, further accelerating the computation. The third
contribution is an extensive evaluation of our monocular VIN
pipeline: experimental results confirm that our system is very fast
and demonstrates superior accuracy with respect to competitive

off-the-shelf systems such as Google Tango [1].},

	Abstract = {Abstract---Current approaches for visual--inertial odometry
(VIO) are able to attain highly accurate state estimation via nonlinear
optimization. However, real-time optimization quickly becomes
infeasible as the trajectory grows over time; this problem is further
emphasized by the fact that inertial measurements come at high
rate, hence, leading to the fast growth of the number of variables
in the optimization. In this paper, we address this issue by preintegrating
inertial measurements between selected keyframes into
single relative motion constraints. Our first contribution is a preintegration
theory that properly addresses the manifold structure
of the rotation group. We formally discuss the generative measurement
model as well as the nature of the rotation noise and
derive the expression for the maximum a posteriori state estimator.
Our theoretical development enables the computation of all
necessary Jacobians for the optimization and a posteriori bias correction
in analytic form. The second contribution is to show that
the preintegrated inertial measurement unit model can be seamlessly
integrated into a visual--inertial pipeline under the unifying
framework of factor graphs. This enables the application of
incremental-smoothing algorithms and the use of a structureless
model for visual measurements, which avoids optimizing over the
3-D points, further accelerating the computation. We perform an
extensive evaluation of our monocular VIO pipeline on real and
simulated datasets. The results confirm that our modeling effort
leads to an accurate state estimation in real time, outperforming
state-of-the-art approaches.},

	Abstract = {Abstract---We address the complete state estimation problem
of unmanned aerial vehicles, even under high-dynamic
3-D aerobatic maneuvers, while using low-cost sensors with
bias variations and higher levels of noise. In such conditions,
the control demand, for a robust real-time data fusion filter
with minimal lag and noise, is addressed with the efficiency
of a complementary filter scheme. First, the attitude is directly
estimated in Special Orthogonal Group (SO(3)) by complementing
the noisy accelerometer/magnetometer vector basis with a
gyro propagated vector basis. Data fusion follows a least square
minimization in SO(3) (Wahba's problem) solved in an analytic
nonrecursive manner. Stability of the proposed filter is shown and
performance metrics are extracted, whereas the computational
complexity has been minimized with an appropriate reference
frame and a custom singular value decomposition algorithm.
An adaptation scheme is proposed to allow unhindered operation
of the filter to erroneous inputs introduced by the high dynamics
of a 3-D flight. Finally, the velocity/position estimation is mainly
constructed by complementary filters combining multiple sensors.
In addition to the low complexity and the filtering of the noise, the
proposed observer is aided through a developed vision algorithm,
enabling the use of the filter in Global-Positioning-System-denied
environments. Extensive experimental results and comparative
studies with state-of-the-art filters, either in the laboratory or
in the field using high-performance autonomous helicopters,
demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed scheme in demanding

Thus, it is important to have reliable methods to pass from one representation to the other. While passing from a quaternion to the corresponding rotation matrix is given by Euler-Rodrigues formula, the other way round can be performed in many different ways. Although all of them are algebraically equivalent, their numerical behavior can be quite different. In 1978, Shepperd proposed a method for computing the quaternion corresponding to a rotation matrix which is considered the most reliable method to date. Shepperd's method, thanks to a voting scheme between four possible solutions, always works far from formulation singularities. In this paper, we propose a new method which outperforms Shepperd's method without increasing the computational cost.},

handoff between two fixed wing aircrafts that do not have access

the relative pose between the vehicles. We assume that onboard
inertial measurement units can provide roll and pitch estimates

relative states needed to do the handoff problem. In particular,
we consider two different scenarios. In the first scenario,
we assume that the relative position between the aircrafts is
measured, as would be the case for a radar or a lidar sensor.
We assume that the two aircrafts do not exchange their airspeed
and turn rate information. Under mild assumptions, we show
that the relative heading between the two aircrafts is observable.
In the second scenario, we assume that only the bearing angle
between the two aircrafts is measured, as would be the case for
a vision sensor. We prove state observability for maneuvers that
are relevant to target tracking and handoff. We also present an
estimation algorithm that uses a bank of extended Kalman filters
to estimate the relative states. Simulation results with full vehicle
dynamics demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach.},

	Abstract = {Abstract---When tracking maneuvering targets with conventional
algorithms, the process noise standard deviation used in
the nearly constant velocity Kalman filter is selected vaguely
in relation to the maximum acceleration of the target. The
deterministic tracking index has been introduced and used to
develop a relationship between the maximum acceleration and
the process noise variance that minimizes the maximum mean
squared error (MMSE) in position. A lower bound on the process
noise variance has also been expressed in terms of the maximum
acceleration and deterministic tracking index. Both of these
results were developed for sustained maneuvers in that all of
the transient effects of the maneuver have diminished. In this
paper, the results for sustained maneuvers are extended to brief
maneuvers. For each case, the process noise variance is expressed
in terms of the maximum acceleration, duration of the maneuver
in number of measurements, and deterministic tracking index
for both the discrete white noise acceleration and continuous
white noise acceleration models for nearly constant velocity
motion. With the use of Monte Carlo simulations, the method
for choosing process noise variance for tracking maneuvering
targets is demonstrated to be effective for both sustained and
brief maneuvers.},

	Abstract = {This paper reports on a generic factor-based method for node removal in factor-graph simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), which we call generic linear constraints (GLCs). The need for a generic node removal tool is motivated by long-term SLAM applications, whereby nodes are removed in order to control the computational cost of graph optimization. GLC is able to produce a new set of linearized factors over the elimination clique that can represent either the true marginalization (i.e., dense GLC) or a sparse approximation of the true marginalization using a ChowLiu tree (i.e., sparse GLC). The proposed algorithm improves upon commonly used methods in two key ways: First, it is not limited to graphs with strictly full-state relative-pose factors and works equally well with other low-rank factors, such as those produced by monocular vision. Second, the new factors are produced in such a way that accounts for measurement correlation, which is a problem encountered in other methods that rely strictly upon pairwise measurement composition. We evaluate the proposed method over multiple real-world SLAM graphs and show that it outperforms other recently proposed methods in terms of Kullback-Leibler divergence. Additionally, we experimentally demonstrate that the proposed GLC method provides a principled and flexible tool to control the computational complexity of long-term graph SLAM, with results shown for 34.9 h of real-world indoor-outdoor data covering 147.4 km collected over 27 mapping sessions spanning a period of 15 months.},

	Abstract = {Although novel aircraft designs can be quickly conceived and built, the ability to develop
and test these concepts is impeded by the inability to rapidly prototype autopilots that can
accommodate unconventional airframes with nonstandard sensor/actuator congurations.
For vehicles that are complex or expensive and that are intended for military or civil
certication and production, autopilots are traditionally designed based on a combination
of multi-body modeling, computational 
uid dynamics, and wind tunnel testing. However,
detailed models are not available for experimental 
ight vehicles, and thus manual autopilot
tuning is needed without guarantees of success. To overcome this problem, the present
paper focuses on an adaptive control technique that requires minimal modeling and limited
tuning. In particular, we apply retrospective cost adaptive (RCAC) control to three aircraft
simulation models. The rst aircraft is a quadcopter, and the second is a xed-wing vehicle.
Next, we consider a VTOL vehicle that can 
y in both quadcopter and xed-wing modes.
The RCAC tunings for the VTOL aircraft in quadcopter and xed-wing mode are chosen to
be identical to the tunings of the quadcopter and xed-wing aircraft despite the dierences
in vehicle geometry. The goal is to assess the ability of RCAC to control dierent airframes
with the same tunings, while also assessing the ability to control the VTOL aircraft during
mode transition.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents the design of a complete control
system for the autonomous landing of unmanned flybarless
helicopters on known stationary visual landmarks. A
state estimator based on the complementary filters notion,
estimates the position, translational velocity and attitude
vectors of the vehicle by fusing data acquired from the on--
board camera and an Inertial Measurement Unit. A visionaided
nonlinear model predictive controller is designed for
the landing motion of the helicopter, assuming that the
on--board camera is rigidly (i.e., no additional Degrees of
Freedom (DOF)) attached on the vehicle. Although the
under--actuated character of the helicopter dynamics introduces
counter--goals for minimizing the error between the
vehicle and the landmark, the proposed control scheme
guarantees, via hard nonlinear constraints, that the landmark
will always be kept inside the camera field of view during
the landing procedure. In order to simplify the derived algorithm
without violating the robustness of the proposed controller,
we reformulate the translational helicopter dynamics
in order to reduce the number of the unknown model parameters
to a minimum. Moreover, a parameter/disturbance
observer is designed for estimating simultaneously the vehicle's
unknown dynamic parameters as well as the induced
disturbances. The efficacy of the proposed landing scheme
is evaluated via a set of experimental and simulation results,
using a small--scale flybarless helicopter.},

	Abstract = {A hybrid force/position control architecture for object
transportation by amobile robot formation is introduced. The architecture
consists of an object level controller that computes actuation
forces/torques to push an object along a desired path. These
desired forces/torques are provided to a multirobot actuation subsystem
that uses a closed-loop hybrid force/position controller to
generate commands for individual robots within the subsystem.
Accordingly, these robots apply the required net force and torque
to the object while also maintaining relative positions with respect
to themselves and to the object, thereby ensuring stable motion
and efficient torque generation. This novel use of a hybrid controller
for the mobile multirobot cluster prevents large environmental
forces on the object. Furthermore, abstraction of the cluster as
an actuator enhances flexibility, making design of the object controller
independent of the number, location, and maneuverability of
individual robots. The architecture is validated experimentally.},

	Abstract = {In this Paper, we present a complete, proof-of-concept sense-and-avoid solution for small unmanned aircraft systems, including a small low-cost ground-based radar system, multitarget tracking and estimation, collision detection, and an avoidance planner. We describe the development of a small frequency-modulated continuous-wave phased-array radar system that provides a three-dimensional surveillance volume. The radar measurements are processed using the recursive random sample consensus algorithm, producing tracks for the intruders and the ownship. We propose a collision-detection algorithm based on the geometric relationship between encountering aircraft. If a collision threat is detected, a collision-free new path is generated for the ownship using a two-step path-planning algorithm. In the first step, an initial suboptimal path is generated using an A∗ search. In the second step, the path is refined using a variant of the potential fields technique, adapted to the sense-and-avoid scenario. The performance of the complete system is demonstrated with flight-test experiments.

	Abstract = {In this paper we present feedback-based information roadmap (FIRM), a multi-query approach for planning under
uncertainty which is a belief-space variant of probabilistic roadmap methods. The crucial feature of FIRM is that the
costs associated with the edges are independent of each other, and in this sense it is the first method that generates
a graph in belief space that preserves the optimal substructure property. From a practical point of view, FIRM is a
robust and reliable planning framework. It is robust since the solution is a feedback and there is no need for expensive
replanning. It is reliable because accurate collision probabilities can be computed along the edges. In addition, FIRM is
a scalable framework, where the complexity of planning with FIRM is a constant multiplier of the complexity of planning
with PRM. In this paper, FIRM is introduced as an abstract framework. As a concrete instantiation of FIRM, we adopt
stationary linear quadratic Gaussian (SLQG) controllers as belief stabilizers and introduce the so-called SLQG-FIRM. In
SLQG-FIRM we focus on kinematic systems and then extend to dynamical systems by sampling in the equilibrium space.
We investigate the performance of SLQG-FIRM in different scenarios.},

This significantly reduces the search space, making larger POMDPs computable.  It is sub-optimal because the POMDP is only solved over the resulting graph.

requires the solution of a stochastic control problem
in the space of feedback policies. In this paper, by restricting
the policy class to the linear feedback polices, we reduce the
general (n2 + n)-dimensional belief space planning problem
to an (n)-dimensional problem. As opposed to the previous
literature that search in the space of open-loop optimal control
policies, we obtain this reduction in the space of closed-loop
policies by obtaining a Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG)
design with the best nominal performance. Then, by taking
the entire underlying trajectory of the LQG controller as the
decision variable, we pose a coupled design of the trajectory
and estimator (while keeping the design of the controller
separate) as a NonLinear Program (NLP) that can be solved
by a general NLP solver. We prove that under a first-order
approximation and a careful usage of the separation principle,
our approximations are valid. We provide an analysis on the
existing major belief space planning methods and show that
our algorithm keeps the lowest computational burden while
searching in the policy space. Finally, we extend our solution
to contain general state and control constraints. Our simulation
results support our design.},

	Abstract = {Recursive estimation of nonlinear dynamical systems is an important problem that arises in several engineering applications. It
is well known that the posterior state estimates in nonlinear problems may assume non-Gaussian multimodal densities. In the
past, Gaussian mixture lters and particle lters were introduced to handle non-Gaussianity and nonlinearity. However, these
methods have found only limited success as most Gaussian mixture lters attempt to x the number of mixture modes during
the estimation process, and the particle lters suer from the curse of dimensionality. In this paper, we propose a particle
based Gaussian mixture ltering approach for nonlinear estimation that is free of the particle depletion problem inherent to
most particle lters. We employ an ensemble of possible state realizations for the propagation of state probability density. A
Gaussian mixture model (GMM) of the propagated uncertainty is then recovered by clustering the ensemble. The posterior
density is obtained subsequently through a Kalman measurement update of the mixture modes. We prove the convergence
in probability of the resultant density to the true lter density assuming exponential forgetting of initial conditions by the
true lter. The performance of the proposed ltering approach is demonstrated through several test cases and is extensively
compared to other nonlinear lters. The particle Gaussian mixture lter is capable of handling the non-Gaussianity of the state
pdf arising from dynamics, initial conditions or process noise. A more general approach that can also handle non-Gaussianity
related to measurement update is presented in a companion paper.},

	Abstract = {Currently, 
ight testing of unmanned aircraft system (UAS) outdoors is heavily restricted
particularly in urban environments and obtaining a certicate of authorization from
the FAA is quite cumbersome. Indoor 
ight testing with localization data can be cost
prohibitive because of the large investment associated with motion capture systems. An
alternative, low-cost solution was developed and tested in which an on-board camera
is used to provide the absolute position of the vehicle in an indoor environment. For
this system, an on-board camera is attached to the underside of a UAS and is used to
track markers that are placed on the ground in a known pattern. Using the camera and
developed software technique, the UAS can gather absolute positioning information by
measuring its position relative to the markers. One of the discussed congurations of
the system can be implemented for $125 on nearly any UAS capable of lifting a 0:26
kg payload. Flight test verication was performed in which the inexpensive positioning
system was compared with a high-accuracy commercial motion capture system. Results
demonstrate the camera system is capable of providing high accuracy localization
estimates in both post-processed and onboard results.},

Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are still gaining popularity in
civilian and military applications, as much as for personal use.
Such emerging interest is pushing the development of effective
collision avoidance systems. Such systems play a critical role
UAVs operations especially in a crowded airspace setting.
Because of cost and weight limitations associated with UAVs
payload, camera based technologies are the de-facto choice
for collision avoidance navigation systems. This requires multitarget
detection and tracking algorithms from a video, which
can be run on board efficiently. While there has been a great
deal of research on object detection and tracking from a
stationary camera, few have attempted to detect and track small
UAVs from a moving camera.
In this paper, we present a new approach to detect and
track UAVs from a single camera mounted on a different UAV.
Initially, we estimate background motions via a perspective
transformation model and then identify distinctive points in
the background subtracted image. We find spatio-temporal
traits of each moving object through optical flow matching
and then classify those candidate targets based on their motion
patterns compared with the background. The performance
is boosted through Kalman filter tracking. This results in
temporal consistency among the candidate detections. The
algorithm was validated on video datasets taken from a UAV.
Results show that our algorithm can effectively detect and track
small UAVs with limited computing resources.},

	Abstract = {Abstract In this article, efcient computational models for
ship motions are presented. These models are used to simulate
ship movements in real time. Compared with traditional
approaches, our method possesses the ability to cope with different
ship shapes, engines, and sea conditions without the
loss of efciency. Based on our models, we create a ship
motion simulation system for both entertainment and educational
applications. Our system assist users to learn the motions
of a ship when encountering waves, currents, and winds.
Users can adjust engine powers, rudders, and other ship facilities
via a graphical user interface to create their own ship
models. They can also change the environment by altering
wave frequencies, wave amplitudes, wave directions, currents,
and winds. Therefore, numerous combinations of ships and
the environment are generated and the learning becomes more
amusing. In our system, a ship is treated as a rigid body oating
on the sea surface. Its motions compose of six degrees of
freedom: pitch, heave, roll, surge, sway, and yaw. These motions
are divided into two categories. The rst three movements
are induced by sea waves, and the last three ones are
caused by propellers, rudders, currents, and winds. Based on
Newton's laws and other basic physics motion models, we deduce
algorithms to compute the magnitudes of the motions.
Our methods can be carried out in real time and possess high
delity. According to ship theory, the net effects of external
forces on the ship hull depends on the ship shape. Therefore,
the behaviors of the ship are inuenced by its shape. To enhance
our physics models, we classify ships into three basic
types. They are at ships, thin ships, and slender ships. Each
type of ship is associated with some predened parameters
to specify their characteristics. Users can tune ship behaviors

the rotation and translation changes of a moving camera from

epipolar constraint, where the rotation and translation changes
are recovered from the essential matrix.We propose a new formulation

estimation accuracy and execution time of the proposed method
with several state-of-the-art algorithms using both synthetic and

in the presence of noise, but it has a larger execution time.
For the benefit of community, we have made the implementation

Many current methods use transponders to self-report state information and augment track identification. While conformant aircraft typically report transponder information to alert surrounding aircraft of its state, vehicles may exist in the airspace that are non-compliant and need to be accurately tracked using alternative methods. In this study, a multi-agent tracking solution is presented that solely utilizes primary surveillance radar data to estimate aircraft state information. Main research challenges include state estimation, track management, data association, and establishing persistent track validity. In an effort to realize these challenges, techniques such as Maximum a Posteriori estimation, Kalman filtering, degree of membership data association, and Nearest Neighbor Spanning Tree clustering are implemented for this application.},

of inter-map loop closures in multi-robot simultaneous
localization and mapping (SLAM). Existing robust SLAM
methods assume a good initialization or an ``odometry backbone''
to classify inlier and outlier loop closures. In the
multi-robot case, these assumptions do not always hold. This
paper presents an algorithm called Pairwise Consistency Maximization
(PCM) that estimates the largest pairwise internally
consistent set of measurements. Finding the largest pairwise
internally consistent set can be transformed into an instance
of the maximum clique problem from graph theory, and by
leveraging the associated literature it can be solved in realtime.
This paper evaluates how well PCM approximates the
combinatorial gold standard using simulated data. It also
evaluates the performance of PCM on synthetic and real-world
data sets in comparison with DCS, SCGP, and RANSAC, and
shows that PCM significantly outperforms these methods.},

The largest clique of potential matches are then found and map optimization is performed. It is a nice paper with very reasonable solutions to hard problems.

	Abstract = {The RANSAC framework is often used to estimate the relative pose of two cameras from outlier-contaminated point correspondences, via the essential matrix, however this is computationally expensive due the cost of computing essential matrices from many sets of five to seven correspondences. The leading contemporary 5-point solver (Nister, 2004) is slow because of the expensive linear algebra decompositions and polynomial solve which are required. To avoid these costs we propose to use Levenberg-Marquardt optimisation on a manifold to find a subset of the compatible essential matrices. The proposed algorithm finds essential matrices at a higher rate than closed-form approaches, and reduces the time needed to find relative poses using RANSAC by 25%. The second contribution of this paper is to apply the optimisations used in 5-point solvers to the classic 7-point algorithm. RANSAC using the optimised 7-point algorithm is considerably faster than 5-point RANSAC (unless planar point configurations are common), despite the increased number of iterations necessary.},

	Abstract = {Abstract---We describe an approach to object retrieval which
searches for and localizes all the occurrences of an object in
a video, given a query image of the object. The object is
represented by a set of viewpoint invariant region descriptors
so that recognition can proceed successfully despite changes
in viewpoint, illumination and partial occlusion. The temporal
continuity of the video within a shot is used to track the regions
in order to reject those that are unstable.
Efficient retrieval is achieved by employing methods from
statistical text retrieval, including inverted file systems, and
text and document frequency weightings. This requires a visual
analogy of a word which is provided here by vector quantizing the
region descriptors. The final ranking also depends on the spatial
layout of the regions. The result is that retrieval is immediate,
returning a ranked list of shots in the manner of Google [6].
We report results for object retrieval on the full length
feature films `Groundhog Day', `Casablanca' and `Run Lola
Run', including searches from within the movie and specified by
external images downloaded from the Internet. We investigate
retrieval performance with respect to different quantizations
of region descriptors and compare the performance of several
ranking measures. Performance is also compared to a baseline
method implementing standard frame to frame matching.},

Specifically, we use image-based visual servoing (IBVS) to track

control algorithms that reconstruct a full three-dimensional

estimation, IBVS is computationally cheaper since it is less
sensitive to the depth estimation allowing for a faster method to
obtain this estimate. To enhance velocity tracking of the sliding
mode controller, an adaptive rule is described to account for
the ground effect experienced during the maneuver. Finally, the
IBVS algorithm integrated with the adaptive sliding mode controller

SD structure and motion to be computed optimally

Having computed optimal estimates of structure and

version of the algorithm (previously reported) recomputes
sub-optimal estimates given new image data.
The algorithm is designed ezplicitly for real-tame implementation,
and the completity is proportional to the
number of tracked features. 3D projective, afine and
Euclidean models of structure and motion recovery have
been implemented, incorporating both point and line features
into the computation. The framework can handle
any feature type and camera model that may be encapsulated

	Abstract = {Abstract---To estimate the relative pose of two cameras from
outlier-contaminated feature correspondences, the essential matrix
and inlier set is estimated using RANSAC, then this estimate
is refined to minimise an error function on the correspondences.
This paper evaluates several refinement methods which minimise
functions of Sampson's error. All perform well on large sets of
correspondences or when inlier rates are high, but many perform
poorly or fail when the inlier set found by RANSAC is small; this
is shown to be because the inlier sets contain remaining outliers,
while missing some inliers.
The most accurate solutions are given by minimising the robust
Blake-Zisserman function of Sampson's error, although this
provides only a minimal improvement in accuracy compared with
least squares refinement. The most reliable results are given by
nonlinear optimisation constrained to the essential manifold. An
efficient parametrisation of the essential manifold as a quaternion
and a unit vector is described; applying Iteratively Reweighted
Least Squares combined with Levenberg-Marquardt optimisation
on this manifold takes typically less than one millisecond.},

	Abstract = {Abstract---An efficient algorithmic solution to the classical five-point relative pose problem is presented. The problem is to find the
possible solutions for relative camera pose between two calibrated views given five corresponding points. The algorithm consists of
computing the coefficients of a tenth degree polynomial in closed form and, subsequently, finding its roots. It is the first algorithm wellsuited
for numerical implementation that also corresponds to the inherent complexity of the problem. We investigate the numerical
precision of the algorithm. We also study its performance under noise in minimal as well as overdetermined cases. The performance is
compared to that of the well-known 8 and 7-point methods and a 6-point scheme. The algorithm is used in a robust hypothesize-andtest
framework to estimate structure and motion in real-time with low delay. The real-time system uses solely visual input and has been
demonstrated at major conferences},

measurement occlusion and spurious measurements. This algorithm
includes a novel measurement assignment algorithm that
robustly creates a mapping between unordered detected objects

	Annote = {Address the problem of tracking stationary targets from a moving platform using computer vision.

Initialization:  The paper assumes that an external source initializes the tracks.  The number of tracks is known a priori.

- objects are identified as single points using some computer vision technique: SIFT, SURF, etc.

Algorithm:
- for each existing track, find nearest measurement.   Measurements not paired are assumed to be outlers.   
- Then for each nearest measurement, find nearest track.  Tracks not paired are assumed occluded.
- When pairing is made, update Kalman track.  Otherwise, propagate using predictor.
- Camera motion is estimated using the average of target motion, since targets are assumed to be stationary.

Disadvantage:
- No track initialization.
- Can't handle new targets.
- Data association is like nearest neighbor and so there will be many missed detections.
- Difficulty handling moving targets.

There is only simulated data with non-real images (Matlab).

on Unmanned Aerial Vehicless (UAVs) increased
spectacularly and led to the design of multiple types

techniques have been integrated in the control

is to present a comprehensive literature review on
vision based applications for UAVs focusing mainly
on current developments and trends. These applications
are sorted in different categories according to
the research topics among various research groups.
More specifically vision based position-attitude control,
pose estimation and mapping, obstacle detection
as well as target tracking are the identified components
towards autonomous agents. Aerial platforms
could reach greater level of autonomy by integrating
all these technologies onboard. Additionally, throughout
this article the concept of fusion multiple sensors
is highlighted, while an overview on the challenges
addressed and future trends in autonomous agent

	Abstract = {Abstract---In this paper, we present a scheme for constructing density
functions for systems that are almost globally asymptotically stable (i.e.,
systems for which all trajectories converge to an equilibrium except for a
set of measure zero) using navigation functions (NFs). Although recentlyproven
converse theorems guarantee the existence of density functions for
such systems, such results are only existential and the construction of a
density function for almost globally asymptotically stable systems remains
a challenging task. We show that for a specific class of dynamical systems
that are defined based on an NF, a density function can be easily derived
from the system's underlying NF.

We also show how the attitude can be estimated under a relaxed persistency-of-excitation condition, with a single vector measurement as a special case. Next, we use the attitude observer to construct a globally exponentially stable observer for gnss/ins integration, based on accelerometer, gyro, and magnetometer measurements, as well as gnss measurements of position and (optionally) velocity. We verify the stability properties of the design using experimental data from a light fixed-wing aircraft.},

	Abstract = {Common estimation algorithms, such as least squares estimation or the Kalman lter, operate on a
state in a state space S that is represented as a real-valued vector. However, for many quantities, most
notably orientations in 3D, S is not a vector space, but a so-called manifold, i.e. it behaves like a vector
space locally but has a more complex global topological structure. For integrating these quantities,
several ad-hoc approaches have been proposed.
Here, we present a principled solution to this problem where the structure of the manifold S is
encapsulated by two operators, state displacement  : S  Rn ! S and its inverse  : S  S ! Rn.
These operators provide a local vector-space view  7! x around a given state x. Generic estimation
algorithms can then work on the manifold S mainly by replacing  with / where appropriate. We
analyze these operators axiomatically, and demonstrate their use in least-squares estimation and the
Unscented Kalman Filter. Moreover, we exploit the idea of encapsulation from a software engineering
perspective in the Manifold Toolkit, where the / operators mediate between a \
at-vector" view
for the generic algorithm and a \named-members" view for the problem specic functions.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a novel path planning algorithm
for autonomous, uncertainty--aware exploration and
mapping of unknown environments using aerial robots. The
proposed planner follows a two--step, receding horizon, belief
space--based approach. At first, in an online computed tree the
algorithm finds the branch that optimizes the amount of space
expected to be explored. The first viewpoint configuration of this
branch is selected, but the path towards it is decided through
a second planning step. Within that, a new tree is sampled,
admissible branches arriving at the reference viewpoint are
found and the robot belief about its state and the tracked
landmarks of the environment is propagated. The branch that
minimizes the expected localization and mapping uncertainty is
selected, the corresponding path is executed by the robot and
the whole process is iteratively repeated. The proposed planner
is capable of running online onboard a small aerial robot and
its performance is evaluated using experimental studies in a
challenging environment.},

inconsistent. In other words, it becomes more confident in its estimate
than it should be. The example is a steered bicycle with range and

Formally modeling the way that humans control and manipulate robots is a challenging and difficult problem, and so the goals of this paper are quite ambitious and have the potential for high payoff. The basic idea of the paper is to model human controlled behavior of mobile robots using two equivalence relationships, namely similar trajectories (after a transformation), and sub-goal behavior. The idea of using similar trajectories is in keeping with Dr. Mettler's other work on motion primitives, and represents the common thread through most of her work. While this paper does not solve all of the issues that need to be addressed, it does represent an interesting and very reasonable approach to the problem. For me, the most impressive aspect of this paper was the breadth of statistical and engineering tools that brought to bear on the problem.

This paper describes why quaternion feedback should not be used for a tailsitter UAV. The basic reason is that the quaterion error is not necessarily resolved along the roll, pitch, and yaw axes of the aircraft in a natural way, especially for large attitude errors. 


As an alternative, they propose an alternative scheme which they call the resolved tilt-twist angle feedback control and projects the error along the natural roll, pitch, and yaw angles of the aircraft. 


Quaternion feedback results in the smallest possible rotation angles, which is good for spacecraft, but not natural for aircraft. The resolved tilt-twist method results in more natural motion for aircraft and should probably always be used.

This paper looks at the case of target tracking (estimating (x, y, xdot, ydot)) given range, bearing, and range rate measurements (r, alpha, rdot). The paper compares an EKF, and an Alternative Linearization EKF (AEKF), to a linear Information filter where the range, bearing, and range rate measurements have been converted to cartesian coordinates, and the associated bias term has been removed. The conclusion of the paper is that the converted meaurement linear information filter should always be used in these applications.


This paper proposes a new algorithm for radar odometry by using raw SAR signals.
The paper uses nearest neighbor tracking for signals.

This paper considers the problem of transitioning a tailsitter aircraft between level and hover flight in wind conditions. The focus is on the control strategy and not on planning the transition. The idea is to use a path following approach where the time index of a preplanned path is manipulated to ensure that the vehicle stay within the flight envelop.


- The paper is limited to planar (X-Z plane) dynamics. The inputs are thrust and pitch angle.
- The dynamics of the perturbed system in wind are derived. 
- An interesting aspect of the paper is explicit definition and calculation of the "hover flight envelop" and the "level flight envelop."
- The nominal control strategy uses dynamic inversion, which does not include the aerodynamics of the vehicle. The inversion is based on the aerodynamic forces being zero. 
- The control law superimposes a feedforward term, a high gain term, and integral action.
- Simulation and/or flight results are not included, and so it is hard to tell how the proposed controller will perform.

doi:10.2514/6.1983-2239


This paper describes a transition controller for a tailsitter. The focus of the paper is on transitions from hover to level control, with the focus on keeping gamma positive but converging to zero.


- "An important conclusion of the paper is the need to carefully sequence alpha and gamma commands in order to carry out the transition."


- The proposed controller is a combination of L1 adaptive control and a standard quaternion controller for attitude control. Dynamic inversion is used to track velocity and flight path angle control. An unexplained sequence controller is used at the outer loop. L1 adaptive control was not implemented in hardware.


- The attitude controller is simply omega{\_}c = K q{\_}e, where q{\_}e is the quaternion error, and K is a constant gain. Gain scheduling is used for different areas of the flight regime. 


- Dynamic inversion: full aerodynamics are assumed to be known. A numerical inversion scheme (secant method) is used to invert the dynamics. Aerodynamics are assumed to be known.


- Flight results are shown using a high thrust-to-weight ratio fixed wing aircraft.

From Duplicate 1082 (Real-Time Optimization for Eye-in-Hand Visual Search - Zhang, Yinghua; Shen, Jinglin; Gans, Nicholas)

The objective of that paper is to search for optimal viewing poses for a camera attached to the end of a robot manipulator. Since the problem is NP complete, the paper uses three sequential dynamic optimization processes to find a solution. Not only does the paper effectively employ two state-of-the-art optimization algorithms (extremum seeking and multidirectional direct search), but it also makes a nice contribution to the extremum seeking literature by deriving a clever stopping criteria based on the frequency of the dither signal. The stopping criteria is necessary to perform multiple extremum seeking optimization steps, to further optimize the estimated range to the target. This paper is a very nice example of a paper that combines solid theoretical results with impressive and non-trivial experimental validation.


This paper shows how to estimate the relative motion between two different poses based on five features in the image space. The paper uses a quaternion representation instead of the essential matrix or a homography matrix. The current solution appears to be slow, but it also appears to be fixable. 


This paper describes an attempt to define the notion of "Well Clear." The FAA mandates that pilots must maneuver to stay well clear of other aircraft. This is an attempt to make that quantitative for UAS. "Well clear" is defined as "the state of being able to maintain a safe distance from other aircraft so as nto to cause the initiation of a collision avoidance maneuver."

The recommended boundary is 8000 ft ahead, 3000 ft laterally, and 3000 ft behind the aircraft. This corresponds to a 5{\%} risk contour.

My understanding is that this data old. The newer recommendation corresponds to a 1.5{\%} risk contour.

- Track before detect is primarily used in radar signal processing
- The idea is to not thresh hold the radar signal, so that low SNR signals can be extracted from the data
- therefore no data association has to be preformed, which is a "well established advantage of Track-Before-Detect algorithms

- the focus in this paper is on extended targets, meaning targets that are large enough to occupy more than one range bin.
- if a "plain" point target model is used, then the filter will diverge since it sees the extra target data as acceleration.

- particle filter using 2000 particles


This paper discusses the definition of well clear and evaluates several different criteria including the relationship between time and position based definitions of well clear.

"The FAA-sponsored Sense-and-Avoid Workshop1 defines SAA as ``the capability of a UAS to remain well clear
from, and avoid collisions with, other airborne traffic. SAA provides the intended functions of self separation and
collision avoidance compatible with expected behavior of aircraft operating in the NAS.''"

	Abstract = { Location: ref DB 4 Keywords: nonlinear, suboptimal, approximation,
Pontryagin's maximum principle Comments: An approximation method
is presented to construct an optimal state regulator for a nonlinear
system with quadratic performance index. The nonlinearity is taken
to be a perturbation to the system, and a parameter $\epsilon$ is
introduced to stand for it. By making use of a power-series expansion
in $\epsilon$, a sequence of partial differential equations is derived
whose solutions form a subopimal feedback law. Given a polynomial
nonlinearity, the partial differential equations are reduced to ordinary
differential equations by separation of variables. The zero-order
terms yield a well known Riccati equation. Higher-order equations
are transformed into conventional type linear equations, owing to
a lemma regarding an extended Liapunov equation. It is demonstrated
that the l-th order approximation for the feedback law results
in the (2l+1)th order approximation to the optimal performance.

The procedure developed has a wide variety of applications. As one
of the straightforward applications, the synthesis of a suboptimal
control is discussed for a large-scale system as composed of several
subsystems of lower dimensions.

Three examples attached illustrate several features of the method.

based on homography, angular velocity, and specific acceleration
measurements is proposed. This corresponds to the
typical situation of a mono-camera/IMU sensor facing a (locally)
planar environment. By lifting the estimation state space to
a higher-dimensionnal space, we show that the problem can
be formulated as a linear estimation problem. This allows
for the application of classical estimation techniques, e.g.,
Kalman filtering. Based on this linear formulation, we also
determine explicitly the motion conditions that ensure uniform
observability of the system, and we propose a simple linear
Luenberger-like observer. A validation of the proposed solution
based on real data is presented.},

	Abstract = {In this work, we study the inconsistency problem of extended Kalman
filter (EKF)-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) from
the perspective of observability. We analytically prove that when
the Jacobians of the process and measurement models are evaluated
at the latest state estimates during every time step, the linearized
error-state system employed in the EKF has an observable subspace
of dimension higher than that of the actual, non-linear, SLAM system.
As a result, the covariance estimates of the EKF undergo reduction
in directions of the state space where no information is available,
which is a primary cause of the inconsistency. Based on these theoretical
results, we propose a general framework for improving the consistency
of EKF-based SLAM. In this framework, the EKF linearization points
are selected in a way that ensures that the resulting linearized
system model has an observable subspace of appropriate dimension.
We describe two algorithms that are instances of this paradigm. In
the first, termed observability constrained (OC)-EKF, the linearization
points are selected so as to minimize their expected errors (i.e.
the difference between the linearization point and the true state)
under the observability constraints. In the second, the filter Jacobians
are calculated using the first-ever available estimates for all state
variables. This latter approach is termed first-estimates Jacobian
(FEJ)-EKF. The proposed algorithms have been tested both in simulation
and experimentally, and are shown to significantly outperform the
standard EKF both in terms of accuracy and consistency.},
	Annote = {This is a very interesting paper that shows that for a mobile robot
with range and bearing estimates, the nonlinear observability analysis
shows that there are three unobservable modes (position and orientation).
However, when the system is linearized to be used in the extended
Kalman filter, the linearized system only has two unobservable modes.
In other words, the linear system thinks that it has more information
then it really has.

The authors postulate that the change in observable modes is what
causes the filter to become inconsistent. They also design two modifications
that select different points to linearize the system, and show that
at those points, observability does not change. With the new modifications,
the filter remains consistent.

	Abstract = {The payload capability of many aircraft is typically limited by the
maximum takeoff weight. However, when in flight, many aircraft can
handle larger loads, but this capability is rarely exploited. The
possibility of using an aircraft cable system to lift large payloads
is studied in this paper. This concept has been studied previously
for single-aircraft, single-cable systems in some detail. The major
limitation of such systems is the need to fly very tight circles
at high-lift coefficients. This limits the size of the payload that
can be retrieved with such a system. To overcome this, it is possible
to employ a multiple-aircraft, multiple-cable system to allow greater
control of the payload position as well as allowing a much wider
choice of aircraft speed and lift coefficient. In this paper, an
object-oriented cable modeling approach is used to study the relative
equilibria of such a system. Parametric studies of different payload
masses and aircraft orbit parameters are presented, and the dynamic
stability is analyzed. Collision-free transition trajectories that
take the multiple-aircraft system from circular flight into straight
and level flight are derived.},

Although the exact computation of association probabili- ties in JPDA is NP-hard, we prove that the single-scan MCMCDA algorithm provides a fully polynomial randomized approximation scheme for JPDA. For general multi-target tracking problems, in which unknown numbers of targets appear and disappear at random times, we present a multi-scan MCMCDA algorithm that approximates the optimal Bayesian filter. We also present extensive simulation studies supporting theoretical results in this paper. Our simulation results also show that MCMCDA outperforms multiple hypothesis tracking (MHT) by a significant margin in terms of accuracy and efficiency under extreme conditions, such as a large number of targets in a dense environment, low detection probabilities, and high false alarm rates.},

	Abstract = {This paper considers the problem of obtaining good attitude estimates from measurements obtained from typical low cost inertial measurement units. The outputs of such systems are characterized by high noise levels and time varying additive biases. We formulate the filtering problem as deterministic observer kinematics posed directly on the special orthogonal group SO (3) driven by reconstructed attitude and angular velocity measurements. Lyapunov analysis results for the proposed observers are derived that ensure almost global stability of the observer error. The approach taken leads to an observer that we term the direct complementary filter. By exploiting the geometry of the special orthogonal group a related observer, termed the passive complementary filter, is derived that decouples the gyro measurements from the reconstructed attitude in the observer inputs. Both the direct and passive filters can be extended to estimate gyro bias online. The passive filter is further developed to provide a formulation in terms of the measurement error that avoids any algebraic reconstruction of the attitude. This leads to an observer on SO(3), termed the explicit complementary filter, that requires only accelerometer and gyro outputs; is suitable for implementation on embedded hardware; and provides good attitude estimates as well as estimating the gyro biases online. The performance of the observers are demonstrated with a set of experiments performed on a robotic test-bed and a radio controlled unmanned aerial vehicle.},

its simplicity and ability to accurately characterize site geometry in three dimensions (3D). While many researchers

various geologic features such as landslides, little is understood how the selection of the UAV platform can affect
the resolution and accuracy of the model. This study evaluates the resolution and accuracy of 3D point cloud models
of a large landslide that occurred in 2013 near Page, Arizona that were developed from various small UAV platform
and camera configurations. Terrestrial laser scans (TLS) were performed at the landslide and were used to establish a
comparative baseline model. Results from the study indicate that point cloud resolution improved by more than 16{\%}
when using multi-rotor UAVs instead of fixed-wing UAVs. However, accuracy of the points in the point cloud model
appear to be independent of the UAV platform, but depend principally on the selected camera and the image resolution.
Additional practical guidance on flying various UAV platforms in challenging field conditions is provided for geologists
and engineers.},

	Abstract = {Over the last 20-30 years, the extended Kalman filter (EKF) has
become the algorithm of choice in numerous nonlinear estimation and
machine learning applications. These include estimating the state of a
nonlinear dynamic system as well estimating parameters for nonlinear
system identification (eg, learning the weights of a neural network).
The EKF applies the standard linear Kalman filter methodology to a
linearization of the true nonlinear system. This approach is
sub-optimal, and can easily lead to divergence. Julier et al. (1997),
proposed the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) as a derivative-free
alternative to the extended Kalman filter in the framework of state
estimation. This was extended to parameter estimation by Wan and Van der
Merwe et al., (2000). The UKF consistently outperforms the EKF in terms
of prediction and estimation error, at an equal computational complexity
of (OL{\textless}sup{\textgreater}3{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}){\textless}sup{\textgreater}l{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} for general state-space problems. When
the EKF is applied to parameter estimation, the special form of the
state-space equations allows for an O(L{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}) implementation.
This paper introduces the square-root unscented Kalman filter (SR-UKF)
which is also O(L{\textless}sup{\textgreater}3{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}) for general state estimation and
O(L{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}) for parameter estimation (note the original formulation
of the UKF for parameter-estimation was O(L{\textless}sup{\textgreater}3{\textless}/sup{\textgreater})). In addition,
the square-root forms have the added benefit of numerical stability and
guaranteed positive semi-definiteness of the state covariances},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a method for determining range using an optical
flow sensor. The velocity and angular velocity of the airframe is
assumed to be known. The raw estimates are median filtered and then
Kalman filtered to produce the range estimate. The range estimate
appears to be accurate when the rotation rates are small, allowing
accurate estimates of the image gradiants. A 3D Sobel operator is
used to estimate the spatial and temporal gradiants in the image.
It appears that this method should allow us to estimate rate without
using a GPS sensor. Velocity would need to be determined by integrating
the accelerometers.

describes two methods for coordinating multiple computing nodes in
distributed networks. They assume decentralized, meaning that data
and control is distributed, and loosely coupled meaning that individual
units spend more time computing than communicating. The two frameworks
for coordination are `task-sharing' and `result-sharing'. In task
sharing, the problem is decomposed into smaller problems which are
distributed amoung the different processers. In result sharing, the
problem is not easily decomposed into subproblems, but individual
agents must communicate their partial results so that the entire

	Abstract = {In this paper we describe a scalable algorithm for the simultaneous mapping and localization (SLAM) problem. SLAM is the problem of acquiring a map of a static environment with a mobile robot. The vast majority of SLAM algorithms are based on the extended Kalman filter (EKF). In this paper we advocate an algorithm that relies on the dual of the EKF, the extended information filter (EIF). We show that when represented in the information form, map posteriors are dominated by a small number of links that tie together nearby features in the map. This insight is developed into a sparse variant of the EIF, called the sparse extended information filter (SEIF). SEIFs represent maps by graphical networks of features that are locally interconnected, where links represent relative information between pairs of nearby features, as well as information about the robot's pose relative to the map. We show that all essential update equations in SEIFs can be executed in constant time, irrespective of the size of the map. We also provide empirical results obtained for a benchmark data set collected in an outdoor environment, and using a multi-robot mapping simulation.},

Theory, George Saridis, Upper bounds, Comments: In this thesis, a
design method is proposed to iteratively improve the performance
of a given suboptimal, admissible feedback control law for a deterministic
nonlinear system. In the case of the nonlinear regulator problem,
the method is shown to lead to successively improved, asymptotically
stable control laws. These control laws are also robust with respect
to parameter variations in the system equation and variations in
the control actuator gains. Moreover, unlike the methods proposed
in the past, the design method requires only the determination of
upper bounds to the performance of a given control law and not the
actual value function itself. This provides a degree of flexibility,
leading to a solution method for finding the upper bound functions
as a Lipschitz continuous tensor product spline function obtained
by solving a linear programming problem. The design method is demonstrated
by developing successively improved controllers for mechanical manipulator
arm. },

	Abstract = {Abstract�The use of accelerometer and gyro observations

in a visual SLAM implementation is beneficial especially in

high dynamic situations. The downside of using inertial is that

traditionally high prediction rates are required as observations

are provided at high sample rates. An accurate orientation and

velocity estimate must also be maintained at all times in order

to integrate the inertial observations and correct for the effect

of gravity.

This paper presents a way to pre-integrate the high rate

inertial observations without the need for an initial orientation

or velocity estimate. This allows for a slower filter prediction

rate and use of inertial observations when the initial velocity

and attitude of the platform are unknown. Additionally the

initial velocity and roll and pitch of the platform become

observable over time and an estimate of these values is provided

by the filter. An estimate of the gravity vector is also provided.

Results are presented using a delayed state information

smoother implementation however due to the linearity of the

equations this technique can be applied to extended Kalman

filter (EKF) implementations just as easily.},

algebra, rotations via quaternions, limitations on quaternions Comments:
Space vehicle attitude control system performance is often limited
by the computational speed of airborne digital computer hardware.
The applicatio of quaternions to digital attitude control problems
involving coordinate system transformations can reduce computation
time by more than 40{\%} over the equivalent direction cosine matrix
solution due to a new method of treating quaternions which allows
the order of multiplication to be interchanged so as to isolate the
most rapidly varying parameters. This paper presents a formulation
for control equations in which the control error is expressed as
a quaternion and all coordinate system tranformations are performed
using quaterions. The new principle of `quaternion algebra' which
allows interchanging the order of multiplication is developed and
used to simplify the control equations. The quaternion control equations
are applied to a three-gimbal IMU example and the results are compared
to an equivalent direction cosine matrix solution. },

	Abstract = {Abstract---In this paper the problem of localize two mobile robots is considered. The robots are equipped with proprioceptive sensors (like encoders) and exteroceptive sensors able to provide relative observations between them. In these observations, one robot detects and identifies the other one and measures some relative quantity. An observability analysis is performed by taking into account the system nonlinearities and for four different relative observations. The theoretical results are validated by simulations and experiments carried out on real platforms. In these experiments, an Extended Kalman Filter is adopted to fuse the information coming from the encoders and the sensors performing the observations. My comments-- This paper provides a nonlinear analysis of observability for relative robot kinematics. It should be of interest to David Wheeler's work. The paper is not very clear in the fact that the input variable is not included in the observability analysis. If the input variable is a function of x, then it should impact the observability analysis. In essense the paper only considers the case when the inputs are constant.},

	Abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-{\$}\alpha{\$}-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {{\AA}} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{{\%}} with default Glide SP settings to 58{{\%}} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{{\%}} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{{\%}} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

	Abstract = {The goal of this article is to review the state-of-the-art tracking methods, classify them into different categories, and identify new trends. Object tracking, in general, is a challenging problem. Difficulties in tracking objects can arise due to abrupt object motion, changing appearance patterns of both the object and the scene, nonrigid object structures, object-to-object and object-to-scene occlusions, and camera motion. Tracking is usually performed in the context of higher-level applications that require the location and/or shape of the object in every frame. Typically, assumptions are made to constrain the tracking problem in the context of a particular application. In this survey, we categorize the tracking methods on the basis of the object and motion representations used, provide detailed descriptions of representative methods in each category, and examine their pros and cons. Moreover, we discuss the important issues related to tracking including the use of appropriate image features, selection of motion models, and detection of objects.},

	Abstract = {This paper introduces a new approach for three-dimensional flight path optimization for unmanned aerial vehicles. It considers the performance of the air vehicle as well as mission specific requirements including the avoidance of no-fly areas, risk reduction in threat environments by terrain following flight or terrain masking low-level flight, and other regulations such as fixed release and approach vectors at the start and destination locations. The focus of the approach is on a proper discretization of the airspace by a network which allows the application of standard algorithms of combinatorial optimization. In contrast to conventional discretizations by grids or grid-like graphs, our network is non-regular since created by some random process. Moreover, each path in the network corresponds to a twice continuously differentiable trajectory which obeys the kinematic restrictions of the air vehicle and which is feasible with respect to the operational requirements of the mission. With suitable costs defined on the edges of the network, a minimum-cost path calculation allows to identify a trajectory of shortest length, shortest flight time, minimum flight height, or minimum visibility from the ground. The latter objectives aim to minimize the probability of being detected by hostile forces, hence increasing the survivability of the air vehicle.},

issues of analysis and design. In this paper it is shown that there
exist orthogonal functions that, in a natural way, are generated
by stable linear dynamical systems and that compose an orthonormal
basis for the signal space l{{\^{}}}n{{\_}}2. To this end, use is made of balanced
realizations of inner tranfer functions. The orthogonal functions
can be considered as generalizations of, e.g., the pulse functions,
Laguerre functions, and Kautz functions, and give rise to an alternative
series expansion of rational transfer functions. It is shown how
we can exploit these generalized basis functions to increase the
speed of convergence in a series expansion, i.e., to obtain a good
approximation by retaining only a finite number of expansion coefficients.
Consequences for identification of expansion coefficients are analyzed,
and a bound is formulated on the error that is made when approximating
a system by a finite number of expansion coefficents. },

	Abstract = {Geometric Fundamentals of Robotics provides an elegant introduction to the geometric concepts that are important to applications in robotics. This second edition is still unique in providing a deep understanding of the subject: rather than focusing on computational results in kinematics and robotics, it includes significant state-of-the art material that reflects important advances in the field, connecting robotics back to mathematical fundamentals in group theory and geometry.Key features: Begins with a brief survey of basic notions in algebraic and differential geometry, Lie groups and Lie algebras Examines how, in a new chapter, Clifford algebra is relevant to robot kinematics and Euclidean geometry in 3D Introduces mathematical concepts and methods using examples from robotics Solves substantial problems in the design and control of robots via new methods Provides solutions to well-known enumerative problems in robot kinematics using intersection theory on the group of rigid body motions Extends dynamics, in another new chapter, to robots with end-effector constraints, which lead to equations of motion for parallel manipulatorsGeometric Fundamentals of Robotics serves a wide audience of graduate students as well as researchers in a variety of areas, notably mechanical engineering, computer science, and applied mathematics. It is also an invaluable reference text.---From a Review of the First Edition:"The majority of textbooks dealing with this subject cover various topics in kinematics, dynamics, control, sensing, and planning for robot manipulators. The distinguishing feature of this book is that it introduces mathematical tools, especially geometric ones, for solving problems in robotics. In particular, Lie groups and allied algebraic and geometric concepts are presented in a comprehensive manner to an audience interested in robotics. The aim of the author is to show the power and elegance of these methods as they apply to problems in robotics."-MathSciNet},

The key feature of this approach is that ground track heading error and lateral following error approach zero asymptotically even in the presence of constant wind disturbances. Methods for following straight-line and circular-orbit paths, as well as combinations of straight lines and arcs, are presented.

	Abstract = {A quaternion-based attitude control system is developed for the
X-33 in the ascent flight phase. A nonlinear control law commands
body-axis rotation rates that align the angular velocity vector with an
Euler-axis defining the axis of rotation that takes the body-axis system
into a desired-axis system. The magnitudes of the commanded body rates
are determined by the magnitude of the rotation error The commanded body
rates form the input to a dynamic inversion-based
adaptive/reconfigurable control law. The indirect adaptive control
portion uses online system identification to estimate the current
control effectiveness matrix to update a control allocation module. The
control allocation nominally operates in a minimum deflection mode;
however, if a fault is detected, it can operate in a null-space
injection mode that excites and decorrelates the effecters without
degrading the vehicle response in order to enable online system
identification. The overall system is designed to provide fault and
damage tolerance for the X-33 on ascent. The baseline control law
supports full envelope operation and eliminates trajectory dependent
gain-scheduling that is typically found on this type of vehicle.
Preliminary results are shown to demonstrate the feasibility of the
approach},

	Abstract = { The problem of dynamically estimating a time-varying set of targets can be cast as a filtering problem using the random finite set (or point process) framework. The probability hypothesis density (PHD) filter is a recursion that propagates the posterior intensity function-a 1st-order moment-of the random set of multiple targets in time. Like the Bayesian single-target filter, the PHD recursion also suffers from the curse of dimensionality. Although sequential Monte Carlo implementations have demonstrated the potential of the PHD filter, so far no closed-form solutions have yet been developed. In this paper, an analytic solution to the PHD recursion is proposed for linear Gaussian target dynamics with Gaussian births. This result is analogous to the Kalman recursion in Bayesian single-target filtering. Extension to nonlinear dynamics is also discussed.},

We take a supervised learning approach to this problem, in which
we begin by collecting a training set of monocular images (of unstructured

learning to predict the depthmap as a function of the image. Depth
estimation is a challenging problem, since local features alone are
insufficient to estimate depth at a point, and one needs to consider
the global context of the image. Our model uses a discriminatively-trained
Markov Random Field (MRF) that incorporates multiscale local- and
global-image features, and models both depths at individual points
as well as the relation between depths at different points. We show
that, even on unstructured scenes, our algorithm is frequently able

Passivity, Linear Matrix Inequalities, Flexible Beam Comments: The
so-called smart structures frequently have more sensors than actuators,
due to the lower cost and simpler instumentation. The passivity based
controller, which is frequently used in structural control due to
its inherent robustness properties, requires sensor-actuator collocation;
therefore, it can at best utilize only a subset of the sensors. This
paper considers the design of a `squaring down' matrix which would
render a system passive subject to some aditional performance considerations.
This problem is cast as a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs)
which can be efficiently solved due to the recent advance in interior
point methods in convex programming. We applied this procedure with
the assumption that the sensors provide displcement as well as velocity
information which is generally not true. We show that the proposed
scheme can be implemented without the use of such velocity information.
Simulation results involving a single flexible beam with torque input
and pub position and strain gauge output are presented.},

combines two control laws to make a hybrid control for nonholonomic

essentially along straight lines to the origin. Close to the origin
a time varying feedback is used to move the robot to the origin.
The paper also offers a nice definition of 'satisfactory trajectories':
(1) asymptotic convergence with bounded states and control, (2) decreasing

The analysis is based on a novel formulation of the SLAM problem, that enables the simultaneous estimation of the landmark coordinates with respect to the a robot-centered frame (relative map), as well as with respect to a fixed global frame (absolute map). A study of the properties of the covariance matrix in this formulation yields analytical upper bounds for the uncertainty of both map representations. Moreover, by employing results from Least Squares estimation theory, the guaranteed accuracy of the robot pose estimates is derived as a function of the accuracy of the robots sensors, and of the properties of the map. Contrary to previous approaches, the method presented here makes no assumptions about the availability of a sensor measuring the absolute orientation of the robot. The theoretical analysis is validated by simulation results and real-world experiments. 1},

Comments: This paper analyzes the formation control problem using
a behavioral approach. The behavior of the group is influenced by
the presence of virtual leaders which can be used to shape the final
formations. It is shown how to get triangle, line, and circle formations.
Schooling and flocking behaviors are analyzed. A schooling maneuver
is defined as 'a steady group translation, e.g., where the center
of mass of the group translates.' A flocking maneuver is defined
as 'a motion in which the vehicles circle a stationary point such
that the center of mass of the group is stationary. Lyapunov analysis
is used to guarantee stability of these maneuvers. A nice paper.

	Abstract = {There are many algorithms developed for tracking and detecting faint moving objects in congested backgrounds. One obvious application is detection of targets in images where each pixel corresponds to the received power in a particular location. In our application, a visible imager operated in stare mode observes geostationary objects as fixed, stars as moving and non-geostationary objects as drifting in the field of view. We would like to achieve high sensitivity detection of the drifters. The ability to improve SNR with ``track-before-detect (TBD)'' processing, where target information is collected and collated before the detection decision is made, allows respectable performance against dim moving objects. Generally, a TBD algorithm consists of a pre-processing stage that highlights potential targets and a temporal filtering stage. However, the algorithms that have been successfully demonstrated, e.g. Viterbi-based and Bayesian-based, demand formidable processing power and memory. We propose an algorithm that exploits the quasi constant velocity of objects, the predictability of the stellar clutter and the intrinsically low false alarm rate of detecting signature candidates in 3-D, based on an iterative method called "RANdom SAmple Consensus'' and one that can run real-time on a typical PC. The technique is tailored for searching objects with small telescopes in stare mode. Our RANSAC-MT (Moving Target) algorithm estimates parameters of a mathematical model (e.g., linear motion) from a set of observed data which contains a significant number of outliers while identifying inliers. In the pre-processing phase, candidate blobs were selected based on morphology and an intensity threshold that would normally generate unacceptable level of false alarms. The RANSAC sampling rejects candidates that conform to the predictable motion of the stars. Data collected with a 17 inch telescope by AFRL/RH and a COTS lens/EM-CCD sensor by the AFRL/RD Satellite Assessment Center is used to assess the performance of the algorithm. In the second application, a visible imager operated in sidereal mode observes geostationary objects as moving, stars as fixed except for field rotation, and non-geostationary objects as drifting. RANSAC-MT is used to detect the drifter. In this set of data, the drifting space object was detected at a distance of 13800 km. The AFRL/RH set of data, collected in the stare mode, contained the signature of two geostationary satellites. The signature of a moving object was simulated and added to the sequence of frames to determine the sensitivity in magnitude. The performance compares well with the more intensive TBD algorithms reported in the literature.},

	Annote = {This paper describes the RANSAC-MT algorithm where MT stands for Moving Target. The idea is to detect a low SNR moving object in significant background clutter. In that sense the RANSAC-MT algorithm has similar objectives to the R-RANSAC algorithm. However, R-RANSAC is different in a couple of significant ways. First, it does not operate on batch data, but rather on sequential data received in real-time. Second, R-RANSAC can incorporate any motion model and not just linear data since it essentially establishesa bank of Kalman filters for each potential model.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes a complete end-to-end system for vision based
trajectory tracking for ground based mobile robots. {\%} Localization
is used to mean localizing the robot in the surrounding environment.
{\%} The introduction discusses two types of vision based localization:
Landmark based methods where a known landmark in the scene is used
to triangulate the position, and Natural Feature-based methods, where
natural features are tracked using stereo cameras to track differential
motion. {\%} An novel binary corner detection algorithm that is 1.6
times faster than a Harris corner detector is discussed. {\%} The corner
detector is used to reconstruct the 3-D world coordinates. Since
lenses lead to image warping, the image has to be unwarped. However,
the unwarping process can lead to strange artifacts in the unwarped
image. Instead of unwarping the image and then reconstructing the
3-D location, in this paper the features are tracked in the warped
image and then projected back through the unwarping process. {\%} Features
are tracked using a normalized mean-squared differences metric. {\%}
Motion is estimated using optic flow, which is found using least-squares
minimization. {\%} The position of the robot is tracked using a Kalman
filter. Also, the position of each feature is tracked using a seperate
Kalman filter for each feature. {\%} Experimental results are demonstrated
on short closed paths using a mobile robot in an outdoor environment.
The camera system consists of three stereo cameras.},

	Abstract = {Autopilot systems are capable of reliably following flight plans under normal circumstances, but even the most advanced flight-management systems cannot provide robust response to most anomalous events including in-flight failures. This paper describes an emergency flight-management architecture that can be applied to piloted or autonomous aircraft, with focus on the design and implementation of an adaptive flight planner (AFP) that dynamically adjusts its model to compute feasible flight plans in response to events that degrade aircraft performance. A two-step landing-site selection/trajectory generation process defines safe emergency plans in real time for situations that require landing at an alternate airport. A constraint-based search algorithm selects and prioritizes feasible emergency landing sites, then the AFP synthesizes a segmented trajectory to the best site based on postfailure flight dynamics. The AFP architecture is general for any failure situation; however, operational success is guaranteed only with accurate postfailure performance characterization and a trajectory generation strategy that respects degraded flight envelope boundaries. A real-time segmented trajectory planning algorithm and case study results are presented for total loss of thrust failure scenarios. This emergency is surprisingly common and necessitates an immediate approach and landing without a go-around option.},

An analysis of the aircraft dynamics and of the flight envelope of the vehicle, encompassing both the hover and the level flight conditions, is proposed in presence of wind disturbances. This analysis is used to derive a control strategy able to enforce the desired transition while maintaining the flight envelope within prescribed sets despite the influence of wind disturbances. To this end, a path following approach is adopted in which the time law is synthesized by a flight envelope protection controller. The paper complements our earlier work (Naldi {{\&}} Marconi, 2011) in which optimal transition trajectories are computed.

to carry munitions in support of battlefield operations,

however they have limited sensor range and can carry only

small quantities of resources. Often, to fully prosecute a target,

a variety of assets may be required, and it may be necessary

to deliver these assets simultaneously. Therefore, a team of

UAVs that satisfies the target resource requirement needs to be

assigned to a single target, and this team is called a coalition.

Other desired requirements for the coalition are (i) minimize

the target prosecution delay and (ii) minimize the size of the

coalition. In this paper, we propose a two-stage optimal coalition

formation algorithm that assigns appropriate numbers of UAVs

satisfying the desired requirements. We developed a Dubins

curves based simultaneous strike scheme. Simulation results

are presented to show that the two-stage coalition formation

features from images that can be used to perform reliable matching
between different views of an object or scene. The features are invariant
to image scale and rotation, and are shown to provide robust matching
across a substantial range of affine distortion, change in 3D viewpoint,
addition of noise, and change in illumination. The features are highly
distinctive, in the sense that a single feature can be correctly
matched with high probability against a large database of features
from many images. This paper also describes an approach to using
these features for object recognition. The recognition proceeds by
matching individual features to a database of features from known
objects using a fast nearest-neighbor algorithm, followed by a Hough
transform to identify clusters belonging to a single object, and
finally performing verification through least-squares solution for
consistent pose parameters. This approach to recognition can robustly
identify objects among clutter and occlusion while achieving near

@article{LaValle1998,
	Abstract = {These notes provide a brief introduction to the theory of noncooperative differential games. After the Introduction, Section 2 reviews the theory of static games. Differentc oncepts of solution are discussed, including Pareto optima, Nash and Stackelberg equilibria, and the co-co (cooperative-competitive) solutions. Section 3 introduces the basic framework of differential games for two players. Open-loop solutions, where the controls implemented by the players depend only on time, are considered in Section 4. It is shownthat Nash and Stackelberg solutions can be computed by solving a two-point boundary value problem for a system of ODEs, derived from the Pontryagin maximum principle.Section 5 deals with solutions in feedback form, where the controls are allowed to depend on time and also on the current state of the system. In this case, the search for Nash equilibrium solutions usually leads to a highly nonlinear system of Hamilton Jacobi PDEs. In dimension higher than one, this system is generically not hyperbolic and the Cauchy problem is thus ill posed. Due to this instability, closed-loop solutions to differential games are mainly considered in the special case with linear dynamics and quadratic costs. In Section 6, a game in continuous time is approximated by a finite sequence of static games, by a time discretization. Depending of the type of solution adopted in each static game, one obtains different concept of solutions for the original differential game. Section 7 deals with differential games in infinite time horizon, with exponentially discounted payoffs. In this case, the search for Nash solutions in feedback form leads to a system of time-independent H-J equations. Section 8 contains a simple example of a game with infinitely many players. This is intended to convey a flavor of the newly emerging theory of mean field games. Modeling issues, and directions of current research, are briefly discussed in Section 9. Finally, the Appendix collects background material on multivalued functions, selections and fixed point theorems, optimal control theory, and hyperbolic PDEs.},

	Abstract = {We address the issue of autonomous navigation, that is, the

ability for a navigation system to provide information about the

states of a vehicle without the need for a priori infrastructure

such as GPS, beacons, or a map. The algorithm is known as

simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM) and it is a terrain

aided navigation system (TANS) which has the capability for

online map building, and simultaneously utilising the generated

map to bound the errors in the navigation solution. Since the

algorithm does not require any a priori terrain information or

initial knowledge of the vehicle location, it presents a powerful

navigation augmentation system or more importantly, it can be

implemented as an independent navigation system. Results are

first provided using computer simulation which analyses the

effect of the spatial density of landmarks as well as the quality

of observation and inertial navigation data, and then finally the

real time implementation of the algorithm on an unmanned aerial

vehicle (UAV).},

	Abstract = { As unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are considered for a wider variety
of military and commercial applications, the ability to navigate
autonomously in unknown and hazardous environments is increasingly
vital to the effectiveness of UAVs. Reliable and efficient obstacle
detection is a fundamental prerequisite to performing autonomous
navigation in an unknown environment. Traditional two-dimensional
(planar) obstacle detection techniques, though computationally friendly,
are often insufficient for safe navigation through complex environments
in which commanded trajectories are restricted vertically by overhanging
obstacles or increases in terrain elevation. To this end, a pan/tilt-mounted
laser rangefinder is explored as a means of identifying and characterizing
potential obstacles in three dimensions (3D). From GPS position data
and inertial sensor measurements, the filtered laser rangefinder
data are transformed into local inertial coordinates and compiled
into a dynamic three-dimensional grid-based mapping of the specified
domain. The Georgia Tech GTMax UAV helicopter and simulation environment
provide a suitable test-bed for verification of the proposed obstacle
detection methodology. },

	Abstract = {We address the problem of verifying motion plans for aerial robots in uncertain and partially-known environments. Thereby, the initial state of the robot is uncertain due to errors from the state estimation and the motion is uncertain due to wind disturbances and control errors caused by sensor noise. Since the environment is perceived at runtime, the verification of partial motion plans must be performed online (i.e. during operation) to ensure safety within the planning horizon and beyond. This is achieved by efficiently generating robust control invariant sets based on so-called loiter circles, where the position of the aerial robot follows a circular pattern. Verification of aerial robots is challenging due to the nonlinearity of their dynamics, the high dimensionality of their state space, and their potentially high velocities. We use novel techniques from reachability analysis to over-come those challenges. In order to ensure that the robot never finds itself in a situation for which no safe maneuver exists, we provide a technique that ensures safety of aerial robots beyond the planning horizon. Our method is applicable to all kinds of robotic systems that follow reference trajectories, such as bipedal robotic walking, robotic manipulators, automated vehicles, and the like. We evaluate our method by simulations of high speed helicopter flights.},

Despite the high level of noise associated with the low-cost sensor

induced on one elevator, one aileron, and one engine. Recursive parameter
identification produced parameters tracking the effects of the failures,
such as reduced effectiveness of pitch commands due to a locked elevator,

were also used in reconfigurable control experiments, where knowledge
of the aircraft parameters was used to compensate for the effect

that recursive identification and reconfigurable control algorithms

achieving an optimal feasible path satisfying a maximum curvature

bound in three dimensional space, given initial and final

configurations specified by position and orientation vectors.

Based on Dubins strategy two types of solution approaches

will be discussed, the first is a numerical technique which

is computationally intensive and the second is based on 3D

geometry from which we will derive an analytical solution. In

the second approach, the computational time is very low and

the strategy can be implemented for real-time path planning

problems. Unlike the existing iterative methods which yield

suboptimal paths and are computationally more intensive, this

geometrical method generates an optimal path in lesser time.

Due to its simplicity and low computational requirements this

approach can be implemented on fixed wing aerial vehicles with

constrained turn radius.},

	Abstract = {The random set approach to multitarget tracking is a theoretically
sound framework that covers joint estimation

of the number of targets and the state of the targets. This paper
describes a particle filter implementation of

the random set multitarget filter. The contribution of this paper
to the random set tracking framework is the

formulation of a measurement model where each sensor report is assumed
to contain at most one measurement.

The implemented filter was tested in synthetic bearings-only tracking
scenarios containing up to two targets in

the presence of false alarms and missed measurements. The estimated
target state consisted of 2D position and

velocity components. The filter was capable to track the targets fairly
well despite of the missing measurements

and the relatively high false alarm rates. In addition, the filter
showed robustness against wrong parameter

values of false alarm rates. The results that were obtained during
the limited tests of the filter show that the

random set framework has potential for challenging tracking situations.
On the other hand, the computational

burden of the described implementation is quite high and increases
approximately linearly with respect to the

expected number of targets.},

	Abstract = {Abstract---This paper considers the problem of obtaining good

attitude estimates from measurements obtained from typical low

cost inertial measurement units. The outputs of such systems are

characterized by high noise levels and time varying additive biases.

We formulate the filtering problem as deterministic observer

kinematics posed directly on the special orthogonal group SO(3)

driven by reconstructed attitude and angular velocity measurements.

Lyapunov analysis results for the proposed observers are

derived that ensure almost global stability of the observer error.

The approach taken leads to an observer that we term the direct

complementary filter. By exploiting the geometry of the special orthogonal

group a related observer, termed the passive complementary

filter, is derived that decouples the gyro measurements from

the reconstructed attitude in the observer inputs. Both the direct

and passive filters can be extended to estimate gyro bias online.
The

passive filter is further developed to provide a formulation in terms

of the measurement error that avoids any algebraic reconstruction

of the attitude. This leads to an observer on SO(3), termed the

explicit complementary filter, that requires only accelerometer and

gyro outputs; is suitable for implementation on embedded hardware;

and provides good attitude estimates as well as estimating the

gyro biases online. The performance of the observers are demonstrated

with a set of experiments performed on a robotic test-bed

and a radio controlled unmanned aerial vehicle.},

(MAVs) can be a difficult problem. Traditional tracking systems

such as radar are too heavy to mount on a MAV and are often

too large for a small airframe. Cameras, laser rangers, and

ultrasonic sensors provide a viable alternative and are light

enough to mount on a MAV. However, each of these sensors

are directional and are often mounted at fixed angles requiring

airframe control to maintain the sensor on a target. We propose

a method of target tracking using a fixed angle camera and

derive a closed-loop guidance strategy to fix the target in the

image frame using the position and velocity of the target in

the image plane to command a heading rate. The resulting

motion of the MAV is an elliptical orbit around the target with

the target positioned at a focus of the ellipse as predicted in

previous open-loop methods.},

	Abstract = {This paper proposes a probabilistic approach to the problem of intrinsic filtering of a system on a matrix Lie group with invariance properties. The problem of an invariant continuous-time model with discrete-time measurements is cast into a rigorous stochastic and geometric framework. Building upon the theory of continuous-time invariant observers, we show that, as in the linear case, the error equation is a Markov chain that does not depend on the state estimate. Thus, when the filter's gains are held fixed, and the filter admits almost-global convergence properties with noise turned off, the noisy error's distribution is proved to converge to a stationary distribution, providing insight into the mathematical theory of filtering on Lie groups. For engineering purposes we also introduce the discrete-time Invariant Extended Kalman Filter, for which the trusted covariance matrix is shown to asymptotically converge, and some numerically more involved sample-based methods as well to compute the Kalman gains. The methods are applied to attitude estimation, allowing to derive novel theoretical results in this field, and illustrated through simulations on synthetic data.},

	Abstract = {The measurement selection for updating the state estimate of a target's track, known as data association, is essential for good performance in the presence of spurious measurements or clutter. A classification of tracking and data association approaches has been presented, as a pure MMSE approach, which amounts to a soft decision, and single best-hypothesis approach, which amounts to a hard decision. It has been shown that the optimal state estimator in the presence of data association uncertainty consists of the computation of the conditional pdf of the state x(k) given all information available at time k, namely, the prior information about the initial state, the intervening known inputs, and the sets of measurements through time k. It has also been pointed out that if the exact conditional pdf, which is a mixture, is available, then its recursion requires only the probabilities of the most recent association events. The conditions under which this result holds, namely whiteness of the noise, detection, and clutter processes, were presented. The PDAF and JPDAF algorithms, which carry out data association and state estimation in clutter, have been described. A simple example was given to illustrate how the clutter and occasional missed detections can lead to track loss for a standard tracking filter, and how PDAF can keep the target in track under such circumstances. By using the Monte Carlo in a simulated based surveillance as an exampled shown. The numerous applications of the PDAF/JPDAF illustrated in "Real-World Applications of PDAF and JPDAF" show the potential pitfalls of using sophisticated algorithms for tracking in difficult environments as well as how to overcome them. The effect of finite sensor resolution can be a more severe problem than the data association and deserves special attention.},

To date, the most common method of handling delayed data in sensing networks has been to use a conservative time alignment of the observation data with the filter time. However, by accounting for the correlation between the late data and the filter over the delayed period, an exact solution is possible. The inclusion of this information correlation term adds little extra complexity, and may be applied in an information filter update stage which is associative. The delayed data algorithm can also be used to handle data that is asequent or out of order. The asequent data problem is presented in a simple recursive information filter form. The information filter equations presented in this paper are applied in a decentralised picture compilation problem. This involves multiple aircraft tracking multiple ground targets and the construction of a single common tactical picture.},

	Abstract = {We present Monte Carlo methods for multi-target tracking and data association. The methods are applicable to general nonlinear and non-Gaussian models for the target dynamics and measurement likelihood. We provide efficient solutions to two very pertinent problems: the data association problem that arises due to unlabelled measurements in the presence of clutter, and the curse of dimensionality that arises due to the increased size of the state-space associated with multiple targets. We develop a number of algorithms to achieve this. The first, which we refer to as the Monte Carlo joint probabilistic data association filter (MC-JPDAF), is a generalisation of the strategy proposed in [1] and [2]. As is the case for the JPDAF, the distributions of interest are the marginal filtering distributions for each of the targets, but these are approximated with particles rather than Gaussians. We also develop two extensions to the standard particle filtering methodology for tracking multiple targets. The first, which we refer to as the sequential sampling particle filter (SSPF), samples the individual targets sequentially by utilising a factorisation of the importance weights. The second, which we refer to as the independent partition particle filter (IPPF), assumes the associations to be independent over the individual targets, leading to an efficient component-wise sampling strategy to construct new particles. We evaluate and compare the proposed methods on a challenging synthetic tracking problem.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we use computer vision as a feedback sensor in a control
loop

for landing an unmanned air vehicle (UAV) on a landing pad. The vision

problem we address here is then a special case of the classic ego-motion

estimation problem since all feature points lie on a planar surface
(the landing

pad). We study together the discrete and differential versions of
the ego-motion

estimation, in order to obtain both position and velocity of the UAV
relative to

the landing pad. After briefly reviewing existing algorithm for the
discrete case,

we present, in a unified geometric framework, a new estimation scheme
for

solving the differential case. We further show how the obtained algorithms

enable the vision sensor to be placed in the feedback loop as a state
observer for

landing control. These algorithms are linear, numerically robust,
and

computationally inexpensive hence suitable for real-time implementation.
We

present a thorough performance evaluation of the motion estimation
algorithms

under varying levels of image measurement noise, altitudes of the
camera above

the landing pad, and different camera motions relative to the landing
pad. A

landing controller is then designed for a full dynamic model of the
UAV. Using

geometric nonlinear control theory, the dynamics of the UAV are decoupled

into an inner system and outer system. The proposed control scheme
is then

based on the differential flatness of the outer system. For the overall
closed-loop

system, conditions are provided under which exponential stability
can be

guaranteed. In the closed-loop system, the controller is tightly coupled
with the

vision based state estimation and the only auxiliary sensor are accelerometers

for measuring acceleration of the UAV. Finally, we show through simulation

results that the designed vision-in-the-loop controller generates
stable landing

maneuvers even for large levels of image measurement noise. Experiments
on

a real UAV will be presented in future work.},

landmarks with known locations, determine that point

response to a RANSAC requirement, new results are
derived on the minimum number of landmarks needed
to obtain a solution, and algorithms are presented for

Passivity-based control, output feedback, dirty derivative, Comments:
In my oppinion, this is a very substantial paper. The basic idea
is to cascade an Euler-Lagrange system (control) with the plant,
also modelled as an EL system, to obtain a larger EL system. EL systems
are passive systems, and so if you make the controller dissipative,
the closed loop system will be globally asymptotically stable. There
are many advantages, including the fact that only output feedback
is required. Also, there are extensions to input saturation constraints.

efficient solution of motion-planning problems for time-invariant

dynamical control systems with symmetries, such as mobile

robots and autonomous vehicles, under a variety of differential

and algebraic constraints on the state and on the control inputs.

Motion plans are described as the concatenation of a number

of well-defined motion primitives, selected from a finite library.

Rules for the concatenation of primitives are given in the form of

a regular language, defined through a finite-state machine called

a Maneuver Automaton. We analyze the reachability properties

of the language, and present algorithms for the solution of a class

of motion-planning problems. In particular, it is shown that the

solution of steering problems for nonlinear dynamical systems

with symmetries and invariant constraints can be reduced to the

solution of a sequence of kinematic inversion problems. A detailed

example of the application of the proposed approach to motion

planning for a small aerobatic helicopter is presented.},

	Abstract = {Collision avoidance systems play an important role in the future of aviation safety. Before new technologies on board manned or unmanned aircraft are deployed, rigorous analysis using encounter simulations is required to prove system robustness. These simulations rely on models that accurately reflect the geometries and dynamics of aircraft encounters at close range. These types of encounter models have been developed by several organizations since the early 1980s. Lincoln Laboratory's newer encounter models, however, provide a higher-fidelity representation of encounters, are based on substantially more data, leverage a theoretical framework for finding optimal model structures, and reflect recent changes in the airspace. Three categories of encounter model were developed by Lincoln Laboratory. Two of these categories are used for modeling conventional aircraft; one involving encounters with prior air traffic control intervention and one without. The third category of encounter model is for encounters with unconventional aircraft---such as gliders, skydivers, balloons, and airships---that typically do not carry transponders. Together, these encounter models are being used to examine the safety and effectiveness of aircraft collision avoidance systems and as a foundation for algorithms for future manned and unmanned systems.},

This paper describes the development and evaluation of a

vision-based collision detection algorithm suitable for fixed-wing

aerial robotics. The system was evaluated using highly realistic

vision data of the moments leading up to a collision. Based

on the collected data, our detection approaches were able to

detect targets at distances ranging from 400m to about 900m.

These distances (with some assumptions about closing speeds

and aircraft trajectories) translate to an advanced warning of

between 8-10 seconds ahead of impact, which approaches the

12.5 second response time recommended for human pilots. We

make use of the enormous potential of graphic processing units

to achieve processing rates of 30Hz (for images of size 1024-by-

	Abstract = { A method is discussed for estimating the state of a linear dynamic system using noisy observations, when the input to the dynamic system and the observation errors are completely unknown except for bounds on their magnitude or energy. The state estimate is actually a set in state space rather than a single vector. The optimum estimate is the smallest calculable set which contains the unknown system state, but it is usually impractical to calculate this set. A recursive algorithm is developed which calculates a time-varying ellipsoid in state space that always contains the system's true state. Unfortunately the algorithm is still unproven in the sense that its performance has not yet been evaluated. The algorithm is closely related in structure but not in performance to the algorithm obtained when the system inputs and observation errors are white Gaussian processes. The algorithm development is motivated by the problem of tracking an evasive target, but the results have wider applications.},

The probability hypothesis density (PHD) filter is a recursion that propagates the posterior intensity function-a 1st-order moment-of the random set of multiple targets in time. Like the Bayesian single-target filter, the PHD recursion also suffers from the curse of dimensionality. Although sequential Monte Carlo implementations have demonstrated the potential of the PHD filter, so far no closed-form solutions have yet been developed. In this paper, an analytic solution to the PHD recursion is proposed for linear Gaussian target dynamics with Gaussian births.

to the problem of disturbance attenuation via measurement feedback

shown that the concept of disturbance attenuation, in the sense of

iterpretation in terms of the response to periodic inputs in the

have been motivated to investigate other navigational sensor
modalities because of the desire to operate in GPS denied

theory, monocular camera systems have received growing interest
as an alternative/collaborative sensor to GPS systems. Cameras
can act as navigational sensors by detecting and tracking feature

relate feature points as they enter and leave the camera field of

A vision-based position and orientation estimation method

method accounts for a limited camera FOV by releasing tracked
features that are about to leave the FOV and tracking new
features. At each time instant that new features are selected for
tracking, the previous pose estimate is updated. The vision-based
estimation scheme can provide input directly to the vehicle
guidance system and autopilot. Simulations are performed
wherein the vision-based pose estimation is integrated with a

the problem of designing a compensator such that the L2-gain of the

establish the interconnection between the robust nonlinear H-infinity

solution to the robust nonlinear H-infinity output feedback control
problem is derived in terms of a scaled Hamilton-Jacobi inequality.

In the recent literature, a simple model for this kind of systems has been successfully used for control design. Such a model has been justified by measured data collected in experimental tests. Here, a similar model is derived, providing a theoretical analysis that gives an explicit link between the model equations and the physical parameters of the system. Moreover, a novel control approach to obtain figure-eight crosswind trajectories is presented. Contrary to most existing approaches, the proposed technique does not require a measurement of the wind velocity or of the apparent wind at the wing's location. The effectiveness of the approach is shown through hardware-in-the-loop tests and experimental results on a small scale prototype.},

	Abstract = {This chapter provides a comprehensive intro- duction in to the simultaneous localization and mapping problem, better known in its abbrevi- ated form as SLAM. SLAM addresses the problem of a robot navigating an unknown environment. While navigating the environment, the robot seeks to acquire a map thereof, and at the same time it wishes to localize itself using its map. The use of SLAM problems can be motivated in two different ways: one might be interested in detailed envi- ronment models, or one might seek to maintain an accurate sense of a mobile robot's location. SLAM serves both of these purposes. We review three major paradigms of algorithms from which a huge number of recently published methods are derived. First comes the traditional approach, which relies on the extended Kalman filter (EKF) for representing the robot's best es- timate. The second paradigm draws its intuition from the fact that the SLAM problem can be viewed as a sparse graph of constraints, and it applies nonlinear optimization for recovering the map and the robot's locations. Finally, we survey the particle filter paradigm, which applies nonparametric density estimation and efficient factorization methods to the SLAM problem. This chapter dis- cusses extensions of these basic methods. It elucidates variants of the SLAM problem and proposes a taxonomy for the field. Relevant re- search is referenced extensively, and open research problems are discussed.},

	Abstract = {In target tracking systems measurements are typically collected in
"scans" or "frames" and then they are transmitted to a processing
center. In multisensor tracking systems that operate in a centralized
manner, there are usually different time delays in transmitting the
scans or frames from the various sensors to the center. This can
lead to situations where measurements from the same target arrive
out of sequence. Such "out-of-sequence" measurement (OOSM) arrivals
can occur even in the absence of scan/frame communication time delays.
The resulting "negative-time measurement update" problem, which is
quite common in real multisensor systems, was solved previously only
approximately in the literature. The exact state update equation
for such a problem is presented. The optimal and two suboptimal algorithms
are compared on a number of realistic examples, including a GMTI

Often, to fully prosecute a target, a variety of assets may be required, and it may be necessary to deliver these assets simultaneously. Therefore, a team of UAVs that satisfies the target resource requirement needs to be assigned to a single target, and this team is called a coalition. Other desired requirements for the coalition are (i) minimize the target prosecution delay and (ii) minimize the size of the coalition. In this paper, we propose a two-stage optimal coalition formation algorithm that assigns appropriate numbers of UAVs satisfying the desired requirements. We developed a Dubins curves based simultaneous strike scheme. Simulation results are presented to show that the two-stage coalition formation algorithm has low computational overhead and can be applied in real-time.},

	Abstract = { Location: Ref DB 2 Keywords: Finite Element, State space reductions,
model reduction, balanced realization Comments: In the dynamics modeling
of a structure, finite element analysis employs reduction techniques,
such as Guyan's reduction, that remove some of the insignificant
physical coordinates, that is, degrees of freedom at a node point.
Despite such reduction, the resultant model is still too large for
control design. This warrents further reduction as is frequently
done in control design by approximating a large dynamical systm with
a fewer number of state variables. A problem, however, arises because
a model usually undergoes, before being reduced, some form of coordinate
transformations that destroy the physical meaning of the states.
To correct such a problem, we developed a method that expresses a
reduced model in terms of a subset of the original states. The proposed
method starts with a dynamic model that is originated and reduced
in finite element analysis. The model is then converted to a state-space
form, and reduced further by the internal balancing method. At this
stage, being in the balanced coordinate system, the states in the
reduced model have no apparent resemblance to those of the original
model. Through another coordinate transformation that is developed
in this paper, however, this reduced model is expressed by a subset
of the original states, so that the states in the reduced model can
be related to the degrees of freedom of the nodes in the original
finite element model. },

	Abstract = {It is claimed that Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) used for civilian/public domain applications will be dominant in the near future. Compared to UAVs used by the military, civilian UAVs are often operated by pilots without formal training, and hence they require increased levels of autonomy and intelligence, especially with regard to reducing threats to public safety. UAV integration into the National Air Space will require that the UAVs support multiple, complementary sense-and-avoid mechanisms, including detection and identification of other UAV-sized targets. Currently, the majority of available sensors are based on infrared detectors, focal plane arrays, optical and ultrasonic rangefinders. These sensors are generally not able to detect or identify other UAV-sized targets and, when detection is possible, considerable computational power may be required for successful identification. By contrast, this paper describes the design of a light weight, X-Band (10.5GHz) radar system for use on a small-scale ({\&}{\#}x003C; 25 kg) rotorcraft. The prototype radar implementation is small enough to be carried by any miniature UAV, and it is capable of differentiating other miniature rotorcraft by their doppler signature. In addition to the overall hardware and software design of the prototype system, a performance analysis of various signature matching algorithms is presented demonstrating the capabilities of the system in a laboratory setting.},

	Abstract = {A bifilar (two-wire) pendulum is a torsional pendulum consisting of
a test object

suspended by two thin parallel wires. The pendulum oscillates about
the vertical axis. The

restoring torque of the bifilar pendulum is provided by the gravitational
force as rotations

from the rest state cause the test object to raise slightly. The
mass moment of inertia is

computed using dynamic modeling, measurements of the oscillation
period, and the physical

dimensions of the bifilar pendulum such as the length and separation
displacement of the

pendulum wires. A simulation technique is described that improves
estimates of the mass

moment of inertia by considering the nonlinear effects of damping
and large angular

displacements. An analysis of the error variance of mass moment of
inertia measurements is

also described. The resulting expression for the error variance is
used to optimize the physical

parameters of the bifilar pendulum to obtain the moment of inertia
measurement with the

minimum error variance. Monte Carlo simulations were used to validate
the parameter

optimization technique. Experimental results are presented for a
uniform-density test object

for which the moment of inertia is straightforward to compute from
geometric considerations.

Results are also presented for a small unmanned air vehicle, which
was the intended

application for this moment of inertia measurement technique.},

with primary application to robotic manipulators. Visual servoing
is dividing into two categories, namely position based visual servoing,
where the vision system is used to estimate the structure of the
world, and then the control system moves the manipulator in the world,
and vision based visual servoing, where the motion of the system
is directly related to motion of the target in the image plane. The
basic idea for vision based visual servoing is to compute the image
Jacobian which relates platform velocities to feature velocities.
Image feature extraction and tracking is also described. },

Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs) in flight using a mothership and

towed drogue, in which the mothership executes an orbit

that places the drogue in a stable, slower orbit that can be

tracked by a MAV. This paper is particularly challenging

in the presence of wind. The equations of motion of the

cable using an elastic model are presented. Based on the

differential flatness of the system with the knowledge of the

wind, the desired mothership trajectory can be calculated from

the desired drogue orbit. A Lyapunov-based controller derived

using backstepping is proposed that enables tracking error of

mothership to exponentially converge to an ultimate bound,

where the size of the ultimate bound is a function of the

unknown portion of the wind. Simulation results verify the

feasibility of the approach.},

is to start with an asymptotically stabilizing control with a given
Lyapunov function, and then to modify the Lyapunov function and hence
the control such that a disturbance attenuation bound is also satisfied.
From an initial reading, it appears that the downside is that $\gamma$
may not be close to optimal, and there is a lower bound on how small
you can make $\gamma$ and have the method still work. This lower
bound, may also be much larger than the optimal $\gamma$. It would
be interesting to try this method and compare it with the SGA approach.

ground based objects with micro air vehicles. The first class of
flight trajectories, called longitudinal trajectories, consists of
switching between clockwise and counter clockwise orbits so that
the average velocity of the MAV along the direction of motion is
equal to the velocity of the ground target. The second class of flight
trajectories, called orbital trajectories, consists of orbits and
straight line motions. Longitudinal trajectories are shown to have
advantages when the ground speed of the target is close to the ground
speed of the MAV. Orbital trajectories are better for relatively
slow targets. As a final result, we show that the optimal switching

In contrast with other visual servomethods, the control objective is not formulated in terms of a goal pose or agoal image. Rather, a set of underdetermined task functions are developedto regulate the mean and variance of a set of image features. Regulatingthese task functions inhibits feature points from leaving the camera FOV.An additional task function is used to maintain a high level of motionperceptibility, which ensures that desired feature point velocities can beachieved.

	Abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have shown promise in recent years for autonomous sensing. UAVs systems have been proposed for a wide range of applications such as mapping, surveillance, search, and tracking operations. The recent availability of low-cost UAVs suggests the use of teams of vehicles to perform sensing tasks. To leverage the capabilities of a team of vehicles, efficient methods of decentralized sensing and cooperative path planning are necessary. The goal of this work is to examine practical control strategies for a team of fixed-wing vehicles performing cooperative sensing. We seek to develop decentralized, autonomous control strategies that can account for a wide variety of sensing missions. Sensing goals are posed from an information theoretic standpoint to design strategies that explicitly minimize uncertainty. This work proposes a tightly coupled approach, in which sensor models and estimation objectives are used online for path planning.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes a new approach for informa- tion fusion in inertial navigation systems. In contrast to the commonly used filtering techniques, the proposed approach is based on a non-linear optimization for processing incoming measurements from the inertial measurement unit (IMU) and any other available sensors into a navigation solution. A factor graph formulation is introduced that allows multi-rate, asyn- chronous, and possibly delayed measurements to be incorporated in a natural way. This method, based on a recently developed incremental smoother, automatically determines the number of states to recompute at each step, effectively acting as an adaptive fixed-lag smoother. This yields an efficient and general framework for information fusion, providing nearly-optimal state estimates. In particular, incoming IMU measurements can be processed in real time regardless to the size of the graph. The proposed method is demonstrated in a simulated environment using IMU, GPS and stereo vision measurements and compared to the optimal solution obtained by a full non-linear batch optimization and to a conventional extended Kalman filter (EKF).},

The overall objective is to minimize the mission completion time
for the fleet, and the task assignment must account for differing
UAV capabilities and no-fly zones. Loitering times are included as
extra degrees of freedom in the problem to help meet the timing constraints.
The overall problem is formulated using mixed-integer linear programming
(MILP), which gives the globally optimal solution. An approximate
decomposition solution method is also used to overcome the computational
issues that arise when using MILP for larger problems. The problem
is also posed in a way that can be solved using Tabu search. This
approach is demonstrated to provide good solutions in reasonable
computation times for large problems that are very difficult to solve
using the exact or approximate decomposition methods. },

is a challenging task because urban environments

are dynamic and have variety of obstacles, and

the locations of these obstacles may not be available

a priori. In this paper we develop a reactive

guidance strategy for collision avoidance using

bearing-only measurements. The guidance strategy

can be used to avoid collision from circular

obstacles and to follow straight and curved walls at

safe distance. The guidance law moves a obstacle

in the sensor field-of-view to a desired constant

bearing angle, which causes the MAV to maintain

a constant distance from the obstacle. We use

slidingmode control theory to derive the guidance

law, which is fast, computationally inexpensive,

and guarantees collision avoidance.},

	Abstract = {Abstract---Advancing research into autonomous micro aerial

vehicle navigation requires data structures capable of representing

indoor and outdoor 3D environments. The vehicle must

be able to update the map structure in real time using readings

from range-finding sensors when mapping unknown areas; it

must also be able to look up occupancy information from

the map for the purposes of localization and path-planning.

Mapping models that have been used for these tasks include

voxel grids, multi-level surface maps, and octrees. In this paper,

we suggest a new approach to 3D mapping using a multi-volume

occupancy grid, or MVOG. MVOGs explicitly store information

about both obstacles and free space. This allows us to correct

previous potentially erroneous sensor readings by incrementally

fusing in new positive or negative sensor information. In turn,

this enables extracting more reliable probabilistic information

about the occupancy of 3D space. MVOGs outperform existing

probabilistic 3D mapping methods in terms of memory usage,

due to the fact that observations are grouped together into

continuous vertical volumes to save space. We describe the

techniques required for mapping using MVOGs, and analyze

their performance using indoor and outdoor experimental data.},

The subsequent data points are then process by the recently introduced Recursive RANSAC (R-RANSASC) algorithm to produce a set of tracks. These tracks are then communicated over the network and the error in the coordinate frames between vehicles must be estimated. After the tracks have been placed in the same coordinate frame, a track-to-track association algorithm is used to determine which tracks in each camera correspond to tracks in other cameras. Associated tracks are then fused using a distributed information filter. The proposed method is demonstrated on data collected from two multirotors tracking a person walking on the ground.},

We show that the classical gated nearest neighbor approach, which considers each matching between sensor observations and features independently, ignores the fact that measurement prediction errors are correlated. This leads to easily accepting incorrect matchings when clutter or vehicle errors increase. We propose a new measurement of the joint compatibility of a set of pairings that successfully rejects spurious matchings. We show experimentally that this restrictive criterion can be used to efficiently search for the best solution to data association.

Comments: This paper first models the aerodynamic coupling that will

flight. A PID controller using linear error mixing is used to control
the formation errors in the presense of aerodynamic coupling and
is compared to a similar design that does not take this coupling

been able to fly for about one century. Although the flapping wings
of animals served as an inspiration to pioneers of human flight,
we don't really understand how they work. In this study, we employ
the concept of four-bar linkage to design a flapping mechanism which
simulates a flapping motion of a bird. Wind tunnel tests were performed
to measure the lift and thrust of the mechanical membrane flapping
wing under different frequency, speed, and angle of attack. It is
observed that the flexibility of the wing structure will affect the
thrust and lift force due to its deformation at high flapping frequency.
The lift force will increase with the increase of the flapping frequency
under the corresponding flying speed. For the same flapping frequency,
the flying speed can be increased by decrease of the angle of attack
with the trade of loosing some lift force. An angle of attack is
necessary in a simple flapping motion in order to derive a lift force.
The flapping motion generates the thrust to acquire the flying speed.
The flying speed and angle of attack combine to generate the lift
force for flying.},

@article{Tian2008,
	Abstract = {Track-to-track association (T2TA) is very important in distributed tracking systems. When the fusion center receives multiple tracks from a local tracker, T2TA needs to be performed before track-to-track fusion (T2TF). The problem of T2TA, similar to measurement-to-track association, can be formulated and solved as an assignment problem, whose costs are based on the likelihood of assigning a local track to a central track, namely, the likelihood of the hypothesis H{\textless}sub{\textgreater}0{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}: the two tracks originated from the same target. Thus the basic hypothesis test of whether two tracks are for the same target is very important for T2TA. Compared to the measurement-to-track association, T2TA has two features: i) The local track is correlated with the central track that has the same origin with it, due to the common process noise of the target. ii) Multiple frames of data are available from both the tracks. Thus, two issues are of concern for the T2TA test, namely, the derivation of the exact test statistic needs to take into account the crosscorrelation between the tracks; and how should multiple frames of data from the tracks be utilized. In this paper, the exact algorithm for calculating the test statistic for T2TA using multiple frames of data is derived. To keep the complexity of the algorithm under control, a limit is set for the number of the frames of data used in the test, which leads to a sliding window test for the problem of T2TA. By accounting for the cross-correlations between tracks for the same target and the cross-correlations across time of the terms entering into the test statistics, the proposed test for T2TA yields false rejections of H{\textless}sub{\textgreater}0{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} that match the theoretical values. Then the sliding window test is compared with the single time test. It is shown that the intuitive belief ldquothe longer the window, the more the power of the testrdquo is not necessarily correct. Thus, caution should be used when using multiple frames of data from the tracks -

	Abstract = { An investigation has begun to evaluate the behavior of small unmanned aerial vehicles (SUAVs) and micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) flying through an urban setting. This research is focused on a cooperative scenario between a SUAV and MAVs for the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Cooperative Operations in UrbaN TERrain (COUNTER) 6.2 research and flight demonstration program. There is great interest in MAV/SUAV use but limited simulation work has been dedicated specifically to issues associated with very small vehicles that cruise at slow speeds near the ground. Development of satisfactory six-degree-of-freedom models of an MAV and SUAV were the first tasks to be tackled, along with the integration of these models into the MultiUAV 2.0 simulation environment. The second task was to model and integrate wind data for complex urban flows into this simulation. This involved creating modules to interface the simulation with CFD results and data obtained through urban airflow experiments. An urban environment for the MAV to fly through was constructed using the geometry of a likely COUNTER flight test location. These basic elements coupled with future cooperative control task assignment and path planning algorithms complete this engineering simulation.},

	Abstract = {Abstract---Distributed algorithms have recently gained immense popularity. With regards to computer vision applications, distributed
multi-target tracking in a camera network is a fundamental problem. The goal is for all cameras to have accurate state estimates for all
targets. Distributed estimation algorithms work by exchanging information between sensors that are communication neighbors.
Vision-based distributed multi-target state estimation has at least two characteristics that distinguishes it from other applications. First,
cameras are directional sensors and often neighboring sensors may not be sensing the same targets, i.e., they are naive with respect to
that target. Second, in the presence of clutter and multiple targets, each camera must solve a data association problem. This paper
presents an information-weighted, consensus-based, distributed multi-target tracking algorithm referred to as the Multi-target
Information Consensus (MTIC) algorithm that is designed to address both the naivety and the data association problems. It converges
to the centralized minimum mean square error estimate. The proposed MTIC algorithm and its extensions to non-linear camera models,
termed as the Extended MTIC (EMTIC), are robust to false measurements and limited resources like power, bandwidth and the realtime
operational requirements. Simulation and experimental analysis are provided to support the theoretical results.},

	Abstract = {Distributed motion planning of multiple agents raises

fundamental and novel problems in control theory and robotics.

In particular, in applications such as coverage by mobile sensor

networks or multiple target tracking, a great new challenge is the

development of motion planning algorithms that dynamically assign

targets or destinations to multiple homogeneous agents, not

relying on any a priori assignment of agents to destinations. In

this paper, we address this challenge using two novel ideas. First,

distributed multidestination potential fields are developed that are

able to drive every agent to any available destination. Second, nearest

neighbor coordination protocols are developed ensuring that

distinct agents are assigned to distinct destinations. Integration

of the overall system results in a distributed, multiagent, hybrid

system for which we show that the mutual exclusion property of

the final assignment is guaranteed for almost all initial conditions.

Furthermore, we showthat our dynamic assignment algorithm will

converge after exploring at most a polynomial number of assignments,

dramatically reducing the combinatorial nature of purely

discrete assignment problems. Our scalable approach is illustrated

with nontrivial computer simulations.},

	Abstract = {The computationally efficient search for robust feasible paths for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in the presence of uncertainty is a challenging and interesting area of research. In uncertain environments, a ``conservative'' planner may be required but then there may be no feasible solution. In this paper, we use a chance constraint to limit the probability of constraint violation and extend this framework to handle uncertain dynamic obstacles. The approach requires the satisfaction of probabilistic constraints at each time step in order to guarantee probabilistic feasibility. The rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT) algorithm, which enjoys the computational benefits of a sampling-based algorithm, is used to develop a real-time probabilistically robust path planner. It incorporates the chance constraint framework to account for uncertainty within the formulation and includes a number of heuristics to improve the algorithm's performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can be used for efficient identification and execution of probabilistically safe paths in real-time.},

	Abstract = {Soaring is the process of a ying vehicle exploiting favourable wind
conditions to extend

ight duration without the use of internally carried energy. The current
research presents an approach for simultaneously mapping and utilising
a wind eld for energy-gain ight. However, an adequate estimate of
the wind eld is required in order to generate energy gain paths.
Conversely, the exploration required to generate a useful map estimate
requires en- ergy. This work aims to address these problems simultaneously
by attempting to maintain a wind map based on observations collected
during the ight and use the currently available map to generate energy
gain paths. The proposed method utilises estimates of the energy
cost and potential reward for taking dierent actions. Wind estimation
is performed using Gaussian process (GP) regression. A path planner
generates and selects paths based on energy eciency and eld exploration.
The scheme is tested in simulation with wind elds consisting of
single and multiple stationary thermal bubbles.},

A derivation of a nonlinear observer on SE(3) is presented, using a Lyapunov function conveniently expressed as a function of the difference between the estimated and the measured landmark coordinates. The resulting feedback laws are explicit functions of the landmark measurements and velocity readings, exploiting the sensor information directly in the observer. The proposed observer yields almost global asymptotic stabilization of the position and attitude errors and exponential convergence in any closed ball inside the region of attraction. Also, it is shown that the asymptotic convergence of the estimation error trajectories is shaped by the landmark geometry and observer design parameters. The problem of non-ideal velocity readings is also considered, and the observer is augmented to compensate for bias in the angular and linear velocity measurements. The resulting position, attitude, and bias estimation errors are shown to converge exponentially fast to the desired equilibrium points, for bounded initial estimation errors. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the stability and convergence properties of the observer. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{MesbahiHadaegh00,
	Abstract = { Location: Ref DB 12 shelf Keywords: formation flying spacecraft interferometry
leader following hybrid control switching linear matrix inequalities
LMI Comments: This paper presents some clever results for multiple
spacecraft formation flying. The main contributions of the paper
are as follows: - A clean mathematical notation for leader-following,
including a nice application of graph theoretic results, - New control
laws for formation flying control based in LMI's, - A stability analysis
for leader reassignment, - New hybrid control laws for formation
control that avoid control saturation.

The notation introduced by the author is very clean and will probably
set a standard for future papers in formation control.

The new control laws based on LMI's are only a small contribution,
and do not add much to the understanding of formation control.

Leader reassignment is a big issue in formation control. If a leader-following
architecture is used, then failure of the leader could compromise
the entire mission. Robustness demands the possibility of leader
reassignment. The discussion in the current paper is good, however
I wonder about the usefulness of the example presented in Figure{{\~{}}}6,
where the follower is circling the leader. Suppose that we desire
spacecraft {{\#}}2 to circle spacecraft {{\#}}1 independent of who is currently
assigned as the leader. It is unclear whether the method proposed
by the authors is applicable to this case.

One of the major disadvantages to leader-following control is that
the acceleration of the leader is used in the control law of the
followers. As a result, acceleration of the leader may cause saturation
of the followers controls. This paper presents a nice solution to
this problem, based on switching and LMI's. While stability of the
overall hybrid scheme is addressed, it is unclear how the resulting
scheme affects the ability of the followers to maintain formation.
Intuitively, the switching mechanism must reduce the gain of the
followers control, which will reduce the achievable performance of
the controls. One criticism of the presentation is that the authors
do not offer any intuition about the action of the control. I would
suggest adding a few (non-mathematical) digressions to give the reader
a feel for how the proposed control laws address the saturation problem.

flow region behind a backward-facing step by means of a small flapping
foil, and the reduction or suppression of flow separation behind
blunt or cusped airfoil trailing edges by flapping a small foil located
in the wake flow region. These studies were followed by systematic
investigations of the aerodynamic characteristics of single flapping
airfoils and airfoil combinations. These unsteady flows were described
using flow visualization, laser-Doppler velocimetry in addition to
panel and Navier--Stokes computations. It is then shown how this
flapping-wing database was used to conceive, design and develop a
micro air vehicle which has a fixed wing for lift and two flapping
wings for thrust generation. While animal flight is characterized
by a coupled force generation, the present design appears to separate
lift and thrust. However, in fact, the performance of one surface

	Abstract = {This paper discusses three algorithms for the problem of asynchronous Track-to-Track Fusion (AT2TF) with track delays, where the information configuration of T2TF with partial information feedback (AT2TFpf) is used. This is the most practical configuration for AT2TF with time delays, since communication delays make full information feedback very complicated. The first algorithm is the optimal memoryless AT2TF under the Linear Gaussian (LG) assumption (denoted as AT2TFpfwoMopt), which is also the linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) fuser without the Gaussian assumption. The second is the Information Matrix Fusion for asynchronous T2TF (denoted as AT2TFpfIMF), which is an extension of the synchronous IMF algorithm. Both algorithms are novel. The third is an approximate AT2TF algorithm proposed by Novoselsky (denoted as AT2TFpfAppr). Among the three algorithms, only the first one theoretically guarantees the consistency of the fuser. The latter two algorithms involve certain degrees of heuristics. Simulation results show that, for the scenarios considered, AT2TFpfIMF is also consistent and has similar level of tracking accuracy as AT2TFpfwoMopt. On the other hand, AT2TFpfAppr has consistency problems. Further more, due to the simplicity of AT2TFpfIMF compared to AT2TFpfwoMopt, it is an appealing candidate for practical applications.},

	Abstract = { Location: Ref DB 10 Keywords: Formation flying, JPL, Multiagent control,
Multiple Spacecraft, Follow-the-leader Comments: The problem of coordination
and control of multiple microspacecraft moving in formation is considered.
Here, each MS is modelled by a rigid body with fixed center of mass.
First, various schemes for generating the desired formation patterns
are discussed. The explicit control laws for formation keeping and
relative attidue alignment based on nearest neighbor-tracking are
derived. The necessary data which must be communicated between the
MS to achieve effective control are examined. The time-domain behavior
of the feedback-controlled MS formation for typical low-Earth orbits
is studied both analyticallly and via computer simulation. The paper
concludes with a discussion of the implementation of the derived
control laws, and the integration of the MS formation coordination
and control system with a proposed inter-spacecraft communication/computing
network.

This paper derives control laws for micro-satellites flying in tightly
controlled formations. Position and attitude control laws are derived
to maintain relative position and attitude control laws. The controls
are based on tracking each spacecraft nearest neighbor. },

	Abstract = {The application range of UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) is expanding along with performance upgrades. Vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft has the merits of both fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft. Tail-sitting is the simplest way for the VTOL maneuver since it does not need extra actuators. However, conventional hovering control for a tail-sitter UAV is not robust enough against large disturbance such as a blast of wind, a bird strike, and so on. It is experimentally observed that the conventional quaternion feedback hovering control often fails to keep stability when the control compensates large attitude errors. This paper proposes a novel hovering control strategy for a tail-sitter VTOL UAV that increases stability against large disturbance. In order to verify the proposed hovering control strategy, simulations and experiments on hovering of the UAV are performed giving large attitude errors. The results show that the proposed control strategy successfully compensates initial large attitude errors keeping stability, while the conventional quaternion feedback controller fails. 2010 IEEE.},

The main motivation and application for this methodology is the problem of fusing displacement measurements with position estimates for mobile robot localization. Previous approaches have ignored the developed interdependencies (cross-correlation terms) between state estimates of the same quantities at different time instants. By directly expressing relative state measurements in terms of previous and current state estimates, the effect of these crosscorrelation terms on the estimation process is analyzed and considered during updates. Simulation and experimental results validate this approach.},

@article{BreugalMorgansenDickinson14,
	Abstract = {Vision is arguably the most widely used sensor for position and velocity estimation in animals, and it is increasingly used in robotic systems as well. Many animals use stereopsis and object recognition in order to make a true estimate of distance. For a tiny insect such as a fruit fly or honeybee, however, these methods fall short. Instead, an insect must rely on calculations of optic flow, which can provide a measure of the ratio of velocity to distance, but not either parameter independently. Nevertheless, flies and other insects are adept at landing on a variety of substrates, a behavior that inherently requires some form of distance estimation in order to trigger distance-appropriate motor actions such as deceleration or leg extension. Previous studies have shown that these behaviors are indeed under visual control, raising the question: how does an insect estimate distance solely using optic flow? In this paper we use a nonlinear control theoretic approach to propose a solution for this problem. Our algorithm takes advantage of visually controlled landing trajectories that have been observed in flies and honeybees. Finally, we implement our algorithm, which we term dynamic peering, using a camera mounted to a linear stage to demonstrate its real-world feasibility.},

	Abstract = {AbstractOver the past few decades, the computational
power has been increasing rapidly. With advances of the
parallel computation architectures it provides new opportunities
for solving the optimal estimation problem in realtime.
In addition, sensor miniaturization technology enables us
to acquire multiple measurements at low cost. Kolmogorov's
forward equation is the governing equation of the nonlinear
estimation problem. The nonlinear projection lter presented
in the late 90's is an almost exact solution of the nonlinear
estimation problem, which solves the governing equation using
Galerkin's method. The lter requires high-dimensional
integration in several steps and the complexity of the lter
increases exponentially with the dimension of systems. The
current parallel computation speed with the usage of many
sensors at the same time make it feasible to implement the
lter efciently for practical systems with some mild dimension
sizes. On-line or off-line multi-dimensional integration is to
be performed over the parallel computation using the Monte-
Carlo integration method and random samples for the state
update are obtained more efciently based on the multiple
sensor measurements. A few simplications of the lter are
also derived to reduce the computational cost. The methods
are veried with two numerical examples and one experimental
example.},

We propose a distributed algorithm with which each node can estimate its offset/skew from these noisy relative measurements by communicating only with its neighbors. The algorithm is simple and easy to implement. We model the change in the communication network due to the moving nodes as a Markov chain whose state space is the set of graphs that can occur. Using tools from Markov Jump Linear Systems, we provide a sufficient condition for the mean square convergence of the estimation error. A conjecture on mean square convergence under weaker conditions is discussed. Monte Carlo simulations are provided that corroborate the predictions and justify the conjecture.},

	Abstract = {The ability of uninhabited aerial vehicles to perform drastic maneuvers
enables them to benefit from wind profiles

that may be unfavorable to inhabited aircraft. This paper examines
optimal uninhabited aerial vehicle flights that

can extract energy from downdrafts for enhancing endurance. Uninhabited
aerial vehicle motions are described by a

point-mass dynamic model. A downdraft wind field is modeled by a pair
of three-dimensional vortex rings placed

symmetrically with respect to the ground. Fundamental dimensionless
parameters that affect uninhabited aerial

vehicle behaviors in a downdraft are identified through the normalization
of the equations and wind expressions.

Uninhabited aerial vehicle flight through a downdraft is formulated
as a nonlinear optimal control problem that

minimizes the average thrust or power per unit time. Vehicle performance
and operational limits are enforced

through boundary conditions and path constraints. These optimal control
problems are converted into parameter

optimization problems with a collocation method and solved numerically
using the sparse parameter optimization

software SNOPT. Numerical solutions systematically obtained for a
range of dimensionless parameters reveal four

basic patterns of optimal uninhabited aerial vehicle flights through
a downdraft in the vertical plane. Results

demonstrate that traditional definitions of favorable winds may need
to be revised for uninhabited aerial vehicles.},

framework for task assignment and path

planning of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles

For multi-agent scenarios in dynamic

environments, a candidate algorithm should be

able to replan for a new path to perform the

updated tasks without any collision with

obstacles or other agents during the mission. In

this paper, we propose an intersection-based

algorithm for path generation and a negotiation

-based algorithm for task assignment since

these algorithms are able to generate admissible

paths at a smaller computing cost. The path

planning algorithm is also augmented with a

potential field-based trajectory replanner,

which solves for a detouring trajectory around

other agents or pop-up obstacles. For validation,

test scenarios for multiple UAVs to perform

cooperative missions in dynamic environments

are considered. The proposed algorithms are

implemented on a fixed-wing UAVs testbed in

outdoor environment and showed satisfactory

performance to accomplish the mission in the

presence of static and pop-up obstacles and

	Abstract = {We address the problem of verifying motion plans for aerial robots in uncertain and partially-known environments. Thereby, the initial state of the robot is uncertain due to errors from the state estimation and the motion is uncertain due to wind disturbances and control errors caused by sensor noise. Since the environment is perceived at runtime, the verification of partial motion plans must be performed online (i.e. during operation) to ensure safety within the planning horizon and beyond. This is achieved by efficiently generating robust control invariant sets based on so-called loiter circles, where the position of the aerial robot follows a circular pattern. Verification of aerial robots is challenging due to the nonlinearity of their dynamics, the high dimensionality of their state space, and their potentially high velocities. We use novel techniques from reachability analysis to overcome those challenges. In order to ensure that the robot never finds itself in a situation for which no safe maneuver exists, we provide a technique that ensures safety of aerial robots beyond the planning horizon. Our method is applicable to all kinds of robotic systems that follow reference trajectories, such as bipedal robotic walking, robotic manipulators, automated vehicles, and the like. We evaluate our method by simulations of high speed helicopter flights.},

This paper addresses the formation control problem for multiple nonholonomic
mobile robots. The approach to formation control is primarily leader-following,
but also contains a hint of the behavior approach. It is also very
close to the template architecture. Formation vectors are formed
from a leader and the robots try to track these vectors. Nonholonomic
control laws that force the robot orientation to be time-varying
are used. Extremely *unsatisfactory* robot trajectories are obtained.
A notion of formation controllability is introduced and the robot
formation is shown to be controllable. Analysis of the formation
behavior is accomplished via averaging theory. },

	Abstract = {Abstract Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have the potential to carry
resources

in support of search and prosecute operations. Often to completely
prosecute a

target, UAVs may have to simultaneously attack the target with various
resources

with different capacities. However, the UAVs are capable of carrying
only limited

resources in small quantities, hence, a group of UAVs (coalition)
needs to be assigned

that satisfies the target resource requirement. The assigned coalition
must be

such that it minimizes the target prosecution delay and the size of
the coalition. The

problem of forming coalitions is computationally intensive due to
the combinatorial

nature of the problem, but for real-time applications computationally
cheap solutions

are required. In this paper, we propose decentralized sub-optimal
(polynomial time)

and decentralized optimal coalition formation algorithms that generate
coalitions for

a single target with low computational complexity. We compare the
performance

of the proposed algorithms to that of a global optimal solution for
which we

need to solve a centralized combinatorial optimization problem. This
problem is

computationally intensive because the solution has to (a) provide
a coalition for

each target, (b) design a sequence in which targets need to be prosecuted,
and (c)

take into account reduction of UAV resources with usage. To solve
this problem

we use the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique. Through simulations,
we

study the performance of the proposed algorithms in terms of mission
performance,

complexity of the algorithms and the time taken to form the coalition.
The simulation

results show that the solution provided by the proposed algorithms
is close to the

global optimal solution and requires far less computational resources.},

In this scenario, UAVs are equipped with sensors that are
subject to the constraints of urban area occlusions. Information
regarding the line of sight (LOS) occlusions in the urban
area is assumed available. Each UAV, considering the dynamic
constrains arising from the xed wing, is modeled as a Dubins
car. The motion planning of searching the shortest path for
UAVs, namely Dubins path, is a NP hard problem. We propose
an algorithm, which can provide sub-optimal Dubins path,
hence can bring a closed-loop path for UAVs to continuously

	Abstract = {An adaptive position-tracking control scheme is proposed for vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) unmanned airborne vehicles (UAVs) for a set of bounded external disturbances. The control design is achieved in three main steps. The first step is devoted to the design of an a priori bounded linear acceleration driving the translational dynamics toward the desired trajectory. In the second step, we extract the required a priori bounded thrust and the desired attitude, in terms of unit quaternion, from the desired acceleration derived in the first step. In the last step, we design the required torque for the rotational dynamics, allowing the system{{\&}}{{\#}}x2019;s attitude to be driven toward the desired attitude obtained at the second step. Two control laws for the system control torque are rigorously designed. The first control law ensures that the position-tracking objective is satisfied for any initial conditions, whereas the second ensures that the tracking objective is satisfied for a set of initial conditions, which is dependant on the control gains. The latter case is included, since it is less complicated than the former control law and may be advantageous from a practical point of view. Finally, simulation results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.},

	Abstract = { This paper proposes an obstacle avoidance scheme for mobile robots
that uses computer vision to extract the relative heading to obstacles
and the angular width of the obstacles and then constructs a vector
field based on that information to move around obstacles. {\%} The method
for obstacle avoidance uses a single camera without recovering depth.
{\%} The method is completely reactive and simple to compute. {\%} When
the robot is close to an obstacle, speed control is used to slow
down the robot. {\%} The method seems to avoid the traditional problems
with local minima. In fact, the paper claims that if the robot rides
in a local minima, that it eventually turns into a global minima.
{\%} The method appears to require the use of an omni-directional camera.
{\%} Experimental results use an omni-directional camera with color
objects. Color segmentation is used to extract objects in the image.

@article{BeardMcLainNelsonKingston06,
	Abstract = { Numerous applications require aerial surveillance. Civilian applications
include monitoring forest fires, oil fields, and pipelines and tracking
wildlife. Applications to homeland security include border patrol
and monitoring the perimeter of nuclear power plants. Military applications
are numerous. The current approach to these applications is to use
a single manned vehicle for surveillance. However, manned vehicles
are typically large and expensive. In addition, hazardous environments
and operator fatigue can potentially threaten the life of the pilot.
Therefore, there is a critical need for automating aerial surveillance
using unmanned air vehicles (UAVs). This paper gives an overview
of a cooperative control strategy for aerial surveillance that has
been successfully flight tested on small (48-in wingspan) UAVs. Our
approach to cooperative control problems can be summarized in four
steps: 1) the definition of a cooperation constraint and cooperation
objective; 2) the definition of a coordination variable as the minimal
amount of information needed to effect cooperation; 3) the design
of a centralized cooperation strategy; and 4) the use of consensus
schemes to transform the centralized strategy into a decentralized
algorithm. The effectiveness of the solution will be shown using
both highfidelity simulation and actual flight tests. },

	Abstract = {This paper presents a vision-based three-tiered path planning and collision avoidance scheme for small and miniature air vehicles (MAVs), which consists of global, local, and reactive path planners. The global path planner generates inertial paths to the goal configuration based on a known world map that may not necessarily be up-to-date. The local path planner builds maps in the local-level frame of the MAV based on vision data and plans paths to manoeuvre around obstacles with time-to-collision horizon around 3--10 s. The reactive path planner reacts to visually sensed obstacles with time-to-collision horizon less than 3 s by pushing the images of the obstacles to the edges of the image plane, thus avoiding obstacles. A strategy that effectively combines the three path planners is designed to globally guide the MAV to the goal configuration while locally avoiding obstacles. Simulation results show the scheme is successful in solving path planning and obstacle avoidance problems for fixed-wing MAVs in urban terrain.},

	Abstract = {Abstract---In practice, the convergence rate and stability of perturbation
based extremum-seeking schemes can be very sensitive to the curvature
of the plant map. An example of this can be seen in the use of extremum-seeking
to reduce the amplitude of thermoacoustic oscillations in premixed,
gas-turbine combustors. This sensitivity to the plant map curvature
arises from the use of a gradient descent adaptation algorithm. Such
extremum-seeking schemes may need to be conservatively tuned in order
to maintain stability over a wide range of operating conditions,
resulting in slower optimization than could be achieved for a fixed
operating condition. This can severely reduce the effectiveness of
perturbation based extremum-seeking schemes in some applications.
In this paper, a sinusoidally perturbed extremum-seeking scheme using
a Newton-like step is developed. Non-local stability results for
the scheme are formulated using a Lyapunov analysis. A local analysis
of the scheme is given to investigate the influence of plant dynamics
and to show that the local rate of convergence is independent of
the plant map curvature. The benefit of this plant map curvature
independence is then experimentally demonstrated in minimizing the
thermoacoustic oscillations in a model premixed combustor.},

	Abstract = {This article presents a real time Unmanned Aerial Vehicles UAVs 3D pose estimation method using planar object tracking, in order to be used on the control system of a UAV. The method explodes the rich information obtained by a projective transformation of planar objects on a calibrated camera. The algorithm obtains the metric and projective components of a reference object (landmark or helipad) with respect to the UAV camera coordinate system, using a robust real time object tracking based on homographies. The algorithm is validated on real flights that compare the estimated data against that obtained by the inertial measurement unit IMU, showing that the proposed method robustly estimates the helicopter's 3D position with respect to a reference landmark, with a high quality on the position and orientation estimation when the aircraft is flying at low altitudes, a situation in which the GPS information is often inaccurate. The obtained results indicate that the proposed algorithm is suitable for complex control tasks, such as autonomous landing, accurate low altitude positioning and dropping of payloads.},

We have developed a novel cost function that can be used to optimally traverse a path that covers a region. The {UGV} model and cost function are developed theoretically and verified experimentally. Our cost function weights force inputs, area covered and motor efficiency to create an optimal trajectory. This trajectory is constrained to follow a coverage path described in the literature. The path is modified based on the cost function by replacing turn-in-place maneuvers by moving turns. Tradeoffs are presented for three cases: (1) drive motor efficiency is not considered, (2) the motors are most efficient at the maximum velocity, and (3) the motors are most efficient below the maximum velocity. Optimality tradeoffs include the time required to cover the region, and the energy required to complete the trajectory. Experimental results using an {iRobot} Packbot are presented.},

Comments: A nonlinear feedback multivariable controller is used to
implement tracking in a nonlinear system. The tracking error is measured
by a general function of system state and the input command. The
controller is robust in the sens that the tracking error is ultimately
bounded in the presence of modeling errors. Free parameters, which
affect the form of the controller, allow flexibility in determining
such factors as: The size of the ultimate bound, the rate of error
decay, excursion of the control, conditions on the class of modeling
errors, and the level of system gain. Restrictive asumptions on the
structure of the model and the modeling errors are required but they
are treated in a transformation framework which allows the generalization
of similar conditions which appear in the prior literatur. These
assumptions hold for robotic manipulators. This application is investigated
at some length an it appears that the resulting control scheme may
have advantages over others which have been proposed in the robotics
literature.},

A consensus-based

the uncertainties in the dynamics and prevent them from propagating
into the commu-

nication network, a cascaded control structure is proposed, which
uses the L1 adaptive

an existing

position

of the real agents, we cannot exactly implement the ideal

ocking algorithm, which leads to

coupling between the communication topology and the system dynamics.
The guaranteed

transient performance bounds of the L1 adaptive controller are essential
towards resolving

this coupling issue. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the

posed algorithms to recover the desired

ocking behavior. The proposed algorithms are

We assume that the UAV is equipped with an autopilot which reduces the twelve degree-of-freedom (DOF) model to a six DOF model with altitude, heading, and velocity command inputs. In this paper we restrict our attention to planar motion. One of the novel features of our approach is that we explicitly account for heading and velocity input constraints. For a fixed wing UAV, the velocity is constrained to lie between two positive constants, and therefore presents particular challenges for the control design. We propose a control Lyapunov function (CLF) approach. We first introduce a CLF for the input constrained case, and then construct the set of all constrained inputs that render the CLF negative. The control input is then selected from this "feasible" set. The proposed approach is then applied to a simulation scenario, where a UAV is assigned to transition through several targets in the presence of multiple dynamic threats.},

The main result is that the paper is an algorithm that simultaneously
geo-locates the target and estimates the heading direction of the

Linear regression is used to obtain the estimates. Therefore, an
error covariance is produced along with the estimate.

The method is briefly extended to multiple UAVs.

For the single UAV case, the localization errors are on the order
of {{\~{}}}10m. For the multiple UAV case the errors are on the order of

tracking control scheme in conjunction with a robust deterministic

multi-rate) mea- surements and a deterministic filtering scheme.
Computational implementation of this estimator-based tracking scheme
is carried out with a Lie group variational integrator, which preserves
the rotation matrix structure without need for reprojection. Numerical
simulation results obtained using this integrator show the robust

the performance of this attitude tracking control scheme with a quaternion
observer-based feedback attitude tracking control scheme that has
appeared in recent literature. Numerical simulation results are obtained
for track- ing an oscillating angular velocity spin maneuver with
both the attitude tracking schemes for a satellite in circular Earth

	Abstract = {Abstract---In this paper, we explore the concept of a trackersensor
feedback loop, i.e., how tracker output can inform
sensor processing, and investigate whether it can improve
multiple target tracking performance and enable stationary
object detection in video. Our implementation of the trackersensor
feedback loop is based on the Gaussian Mixture Models
(GMM) foreground detector. We modify the standard GMM
algorithm by measuring target extent directly from the foreground
mask and by zeroing out the background update rate of
pixels associated with valid tracks. Our tracker-sensor feedback
loop is incorporated into the Recursive-RANSAC framework.
Recursive-RANSAC, a novel multiple target tracker, is enhanced
with the inclusion of the probabilistic data association filter and
nearly constant jerk motion model. We apply our algorithm to
several pseudo-aerial videos that are similar to what might be
captured from a UAV platform. The multiple object tracking
precision and accuracy (MOTP and MOTA) and optimal
sub-pattern assignment (OSPA) metrics are used to measure
tracking performance. Tracker-sensor feedback is shown to
produce a significant improvement in the number of missed
detections, false positives, and track label switches. In terms of
stationary object detection, we demonstrate our method's ability
to indefinitely detect parking cars and abandoned luggage (from
the PETS 2006 dataset) despite frequent occlusions and other
detection challenges.},

The estimated distribution is compared to a previously generated

suboptimal control, nonlinear systems, Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation
Comments: Theoretical procedures are developed for camparing the
performance of arbitrarily selected admissible feedback controls
amoung themselves with the optimal solution of a nonlinear optimal
stochastic control problem. Iterative design schemes are proposed
for successively improving the performance of a controller until
a satisfactory design is achieved. Specifically, the exact design
procedure is based on the generalized Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation
of the cost function of nonlinear stochastic systems, and teh approximate
design procedure for the infinite-time nonlinear stochastic regulator
problem, is developed by using the upper and lower bounds of the
cost functions. Stability of this problem is also considered. For
a given controller, both the upper and lower bounds to its cost function
can be obtained by solving a partial differential inequality. These
bounds, constructed without actually knowing the optimal controller,
are used as measure to evaluate the acceptability of suboptimal controllers.
These results establish an approximation theory of optimal stochastic
control and provide a practical procedure for selecting effective
practical controls for nonlinear stochastic systems. An Entropy reformulation
of the Generalized Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation is also presented.

	Abstract = {Miniature air vehicles (MAVs) are often used for low altitude flights where unknown obstacles might be encountered. Path planning and obstacle avoidance for MAVs involve planning a feasible path from an initial state to a goal state while avoiding obstacles in the environment. This paper presents a vision-based local multi-resolution mapping and path planning technique for MAVs using a forward-looking onboard camera. A depth map, which represents the time-to-collision (TTC) and bearing information of the obstacles, is obtained by computer vision algorithms. To account for measurement uncertainties introduced by the camera, a multi-resolution map in the body frame of the MAV is created in polar coordinates. Using the depth map, the locations of the obstacles are determined in the multi-resolution map. Dijkstra's algorithm is employed to find a collision-free path in the body frame. The simulation and flight test results show that the proposed technique is successful in solving path planning and multiple obstacles avoidance problems for MAVs.},

formation flying UAVs Dijkstra's algorithm fault reconfiguration
communication leader-following behavioral scheme (kinda) distributed
Comments: This paper discusses close formation flight for multiple
UAV's, and possibly manned vehicles. The main focus of the paper
is on reconfiguring the communication channels between aircraft.
The dynamics assumed for the aircraft are linearized lateral and
longitudinal dynamics about trim conditions. An autopilot is designed
using LQR techniques. Similar to our current approach, the inputs
to the autopilot are velocity, altitude and heading commands. The
formation controller is a leader following scheme that uses LQ controllers
to track the trajectory of the leader. The leader following scheme
can also be adjusted slightly to accommadate the relative position
of other aircraft. The communication channels are configured using
Dijkstra's algorithm to choose optimal, and suboptimal backup, links.
Three types of communcation faults are discussed: Aircraft loss,
transmitter failure, and receiver failure. Ad hoc, but deterministic
(i.e., pre-programmed) schemes are persented deal with each of these
failures. While distributed, the resolution to these faults does
not constitute coordinated behavior. },

policies as well as the resulting optimal costs are quadratic in

for the bilinear system at hand. The resulting optimal and stabilized
closed-loop system is of third order with respect to the state. One

The basic idea of the paper is to use a `generalized cost function'

	Abstract = {Wireless networks have historically considered support for mobile
elements as an extra overhead. However, recent research has provided
means by which network can take advantage of mobile elements. Particularly,
in the case of wireless sensor networks, mobile elements are deliberately
built into the system to improve the lifetime of the network, and
act as mechanical carriers of data. The mobile element, which is
controlled, visits the nodes to collect their data before their buffers
are full. It may happen that the sensor nodes are sampling at different
rates, in which case some nodes need to be visited more frequently
than others. We present this problem of scheduling the mobile element
in the network, so that there is no data loss due to buffer overflow.
We prove that the problem is NP-complete and give an ILP formulation.
We give some practical algorithms, and compare their performances.},

through the use of pseudo measurements of slant range from
each sensor to the target and pseudo measurements of each
sensor's bias. The covariance intersection (CI) algorithm is
used to produce a pseudo measurement of slant range. This
pseudo measurement of range allows pseudo measurements of
sensor bias to be calculated based on each sensor's residuals and
Kalman gains. Substantially improved tracking performance
is demonstrated when estimating and accounting for constant

Both the guidance schemes are applied to the underactuated LAUV vehicle in the same environmental conditions with the same speed and heading controllers. The comparison separates between transient and steady-state behaviour, with focus on the latter. In particular, the cross-track error transfer functions for small time varying disturbances are derived for the two guidance schemes at equilibrium and similarities are found with the experimental results. The analysis concludes good path following performance for both the VF and the ILOS guidance laws, with the VF controller performing slightly better.

The proposed calibration methods utilize the fact that ideally the norm of the measured output of the accelerom- eter and gyro cluster are equal to the magnitude of applied force and rotational velocity, respectively. This fact, together with model of the sensors is used to construct a cost function, which is minimized with respect to the unknown model para- meters using Newtons method. The performance of the cali- bration algorithm is compared with the Crame r-Rao bound for the case when a mechanical platform is used to rotate the IMU into different precisely controlled orientations. Simulation re- sults shows that the mean square error of the estimated sen- sor model parameters reaches the Crame r-Rao bound within 8 dB, and thus the proposed method may be acceptable PfSofrarg reaplacements wide range of low-cost applications.},

When data travel along unreliable communication channels in a large, wireless, multihop sensor network, the effect of communication delays and loss of information in the control loop cannot be neglected. We address this problem starting from the discrete Kalman filtering formulation, and modeling the arrival of the observation as a random process. We study the statistical convergence properties of the estimation error covariance, showing the existence of a critical value for the arrival rate of the observations, beyond which a transition to an unbounded state error covariance occurs. We also give upper and lower bounds on this expected state error covariance.},

	Abstract = {This paper considers the problem of obtaining good attitude estimates from measurements obtained from typical low cost inertial measurement units. The outputs of such systems are characterized by high noise levels and time varying additive biases. We formulate the filtering problem as deterministic observer kinematics posed directly on the special orthogonal group SO (3) driven by reconstructed attitude and angular velocity measurements. Lyapunov analysis results for the proposed observers are derived that ensure almost global stability of the observer error. The approach taken leads to an observer that we term the direct complementary filter. By exploiting the geometry of the special orthogonal group a related observer, termed the passive complementary filter, is derived that decouples the gyro measurements from the reconstructed attitude in the observer inputs. Both the direct and passive filters can be extended to estimate gyro bias online. The passive filter is further developed to provide a formulation in terms of the measurement error that avoids any algebraic reconstruction of the attitude. This leads to an observer on SO(3), termed the explicit complementary filter, that requires only accelerometer and gyro outputs; is suitable for implementation on embedded hardware; and provides good attitude estimates as well as estimating the gyro biases online. The performance of the observers are demonstrated with a set of experiments performed on a robotic test-bed and a radio controlled unmanned aerial vehicle.},

This paper describes an approach to satellite formation keeping,
for satellites in low-earth orbit. The basic idea is to keep track
of the time that the satellite crosses the equator and the procession
rate. The time and positions are then controlled by in-plane thrusting
and orthogonal plane thrusting respectively. Advantages of the method
include: small amounts of computation, no communication necessary
between satellites, near-optimum fuel efficiency in the presence
of drag, and external measurements imply no accumulation of errors
in navigational data. GPS measurements are used for navigation. },

This paper introduces an optimization technique fur segmented three-dimensional simultaneous noninterfering trajectory design based on an incremental search strategy that combines a k-ary tree with Dijkstra's algorithm. Existing fixed-wing traffic corridors are modeled as impenetrable obstacles. The objective function is based on a validated AH-1 rotorcraft noise model as well as terminal area population density data. Flight envelope limits are represented as search-space constraints. Candidate final approach trajectories for Baltimore-Washington International (BWI) Airport are presented, illustrating the effects of population density, entry region, and varied number of trajectory segments on the optimal result. The modeling and optimization technique presented in this paper will provide airport and airspace designers with a host of alterative trajectory options for analysis of potential landing sites, associated traffic procedures, and entry options, as shown by the presented BWI case study.},

selected when the ground vehicle is moving slowly compared to the

	Abstract = {Abstract---Learning models of the environment is one of the

fundamental tasks of mobile robots since maps are needed for a

wide range of robotic applications, such as navigation and transportation

tasks, service robotic applications, and several others.

In the past, numerous efficient approaches to map learning have

been proposed.Most of them, however, assume that the robot lives

on a plane. In this paper, we present a highly efficient maximumlikelihood

approach that is able to solve 3-D and 2-D problems.

Our approach addresses the so-called graph-based formulation of

simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and can be seen as

an extension of Olson's algorithm toward non-flat environments.

It applies a novel parameterization of the nodes of the graph that

significantly improves the performance of the algorithm and can

cope with arbitrary network topologies. The latter allows us to

bound the complexity of the algorithm to the size of the mapped

area and not to the length of the trajectory. Furthermore, our

approach is able to appropriately distribute the roll, pitch, and

yaw error over a sequence of poses in 3-D mapping problems. We

implemented our technique and compared it with multiple other

graph-based SLAM solutions. As we demonstrate in simulated

and real-world experiments, our method converges faster than the

other approaches and yields accurate maps of the environment.},

	Abstract = {In the past few decades, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become promising mobile platforms capable of navigating semiautonomously or autonomously in uncertain environments. The level of autonomy and the flexible technology of these flying robots have rapidly evolved, making it possible to coordinate teams of UAVs in a wide spectrum of tasks. These applications include search and rescue missions; disaster relief operations, such as forest fires [1]; and environmental monitoring and surveillance. In some of these tasks, UAVs work in coordination with other robots, as in robot-assisted inspection at sea [2]. Recently, radio-controlled UAVs carrying radiation sensors and video cameras were used to monitor, diagnose, and evaluate the situation at Japans Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant facility [3].},

for active sensing by

unmanned aircraft systems in realistic communication environments.
The position dependency

of wireless networked communication is modeled using the standard
empirical radio model

in combination with Shannon capacity or a packet erasure channel.
The covariance of the

extended information filter is used to model sensed information content.
The two information-

theoretic concepts are then combined into a single optimization metric.
Decentralized control

laws are developed for simplified network scenarios. Stochastic approximation
and extremum

seeking control techniques are used to estimate the gradient of the
sampled objective function.

Experimental flight results demonstrate the capabilities of the active
sensing framework.},

based guidance control laws. A Lyapunov function is introduced for
the guidance law and two different nonlinear control laws are derived,
one based on quickest descent of the Lyapunov function, and the other
based on steepest descent of the Lyapunov function. The method would
be conducive to Will Curtis's satisficing control paradigm. The two
control laws are compared to standard proportional navigation and
augmented proportional navigation. In the simulations presented in
the paper, the results of the nonlinear guidance law are better than
the results of proportional navigation. The key advantage of the
technique is that it does not use the line-of-sight rate for the
guidance law. Instead, it uses the aspect angle of the target. },

high-frequency jitter caused by environmental disturbances such as
wind gusts. This paper

describes a methodology for producing real-time stabilized video by
eliminating jitter.Video

stabilization is enabled by estimating the intended video motion through
the methodical selection

and tracking of image features from one frame to the next. The effectiveness
of the video

stabilization routine is demonstrated in a real-world surveillance
task of localizing stationary

and moving targets on a mobile ground station. The paper also describes
the unique mobile

platform that is used to create and refine these miniature-air-vehicle-specific
computer vision

technologies.},

mobile robots coordination nonholonomic robots reachability graphs
Comments: This is a nice paper on using virtual structures for formation
control. The basic idea is to treat the formation as a virtual structure,
with the desired positions of the robots as points within the virtual
structure. A formal definition of a virtual structure is given. The
control algorithm operates by first moving the virtual structure
(VS), then moving the robots to conform the the VS, and finally least
square fitting the virtual structure to the final robot positions.
Feedback to the formation is thereby explicitly encoded into the
algorithm. Another clever idea presented in the paper is that of
reachability graphs for mobile robots. The nodes of possible VS positions
are constrained to lie within the reachability graphs of each, thereby
ensuring that the required motion of each robot is feasible. Several
simulation and experimental scenarios are described including translation,
rotation, robot failure and docking. Formation errors on the order
of 1cm are obtained. The paper also contains a nice literature survey,
and a summary of the advantages of the virtual structure approach.},

algorithm that is precise, robust, and faster than current
state-of-the-art methods. The semi-direct approach eliminates
the need of costly feature extraction and robust matching
techniques for motion estimation. Our algorithm operates
directly on pixel intensities, which results in subpixel precision
at high frame-rates. A probabilistic mapping method that
explicitly models outlier measurements is used to estimate 3D
points, which results in fewer outliers and more reliable points.
Precise and high frame-rate motion estimation brings increased
robustness in scenes of little, repetitive, and high-frequency
texture. The algorithm is applied to micro-aerial-vehicle stateestimation
in GPS-denied environments and runs at 55 frames
per second on the onboard embedded computer and at more

regulator Comments: The purpose of this paper is to formulate, study,
and resolve the inverse problem of optimal control theory, which
is the following: Given a control law, find all performance indices
for which this control law is optimal.

Under the assumptions of (a) linear constant plant, (b) linear constant
control law, (c) measurable state vvariables, (d) quadratic loss
functions with constant coefficients, (e) single control variable,
we give a complete analysis of this problem and obtain various explicit
conditions for the optimality of a given control law. An interesting
feature of the analysis is the central role of frequency-domain concepts,
which have been ignored in optimal control theory until very recently.
The discussion is presented in rigorous mathematical form.

The central conclusion is the following: A stable control law is
optimal if and only if the absolute value of the corresponding return
difference is at least equal to one at all frequencies. This provides
a beautifully simple connecting link between modern control theory
and the classical point of view which regards feedback as a means
of reducing component variations. },

path planner. The sampling method is called the bridge test and is
ideally suited to planning in spaces with narrow passages. The basic
idea is to sample points around a point that is within an obstacle.
If two endpoints are in the obstacle and the midpoint is not, then
it is accepted as a milestone for the planner (since it is in a narrow
passage). The bridge builder is combined with uniform sampling to
create a hybrid sampling scheme which appears to give good results
for a large variety of path planning problems.},

The formulation is general for various metal-forming processes including
forging and extrusion operations. The state variables selected in
the formulation are the die/billet contact nodal velocities and the
nodal velocities of the critical finite elements of the billet. The
control input is the ram velocity, which is determined by using the
linear quadratic regulator theory to maintain desired strain rates
within the selected finite elements. The influence of an optimally
designed ram velocity on the deforming material is studied using
performance measures. This paper includes the development of the
state-space model from non-linear finite element formulation, optimal

function candidate suitable for the synthesis of guidance laws, which
are free of singularities, and for the analysis of missile-target
system stability taking into account the whole state, namely LOS
angle, LOS rate, and relative missile-target range. The paper proposed
nonlinear guidance laws for two classes of target maneuvers: 1) no
maneuver and 2) maneuvering target with delayed estimates of target
acceleration available to the guidance law. It was shown that uniform
ultimate boundedness of the missile-target system state is obtained
in the case of highly maneuvering targets. For a nonmaneuvering target,
asymptotic stability was demonstrated. Numerical simulations showed
that the nonlinear guidance laws proposed in this paper result in
improved performance when compared with PNG. In this paper, the flight
control system dynamics were assumed to be ideal. However, it is
known that system lags result in miss distances, and therefore the
work presented in this paper is currently being extended to the synthesis
of a more sophisticated nonlinear guidance law that takes into account
uncertain missile dynamics. },

	Abstract = {In this paper we present a prototype system for image based localization in urban environments. Given a database of views of city street scenes tagged by GPS locations, the system computes the GPS location of a novel query view. We first use a wide-baseline matching technique based on SIFT features to select the closest views in the database. Often due to a large change of viewpoint and presence of repetitive structures, a large percentage of matches ({\&}gt; 50{\%}) are not correct correspondences. The subsequent motion estimation between the query view and the reference view, is then handled by a novel and efficient robust estimation technique capable of dealing with large percentage of outliers. This stage is also accompanied by a model selection step among the fundamental matrix and the homography. Once the motion between the closest reference views is estimated, the location of the query view is then obtained by triangulation of translation directions. Approximate solutions for cases when triangulation cannot be obtained reliably are also described. The presented system is tested on the dataset used in ICCV 2005 Computer Vision Contest and is shown to have higher accuracy than previous reported results.},

of nonlinear plant, a direct feedback linearizing compensator and
a following feedback controller can be composed by physical variables
of the plant. By using this method to power systems, a nonlinear
excitation control of synchronous generator is proposed, which is
new and effective for engineering. Digital simulation and physical

	Abstract = {This paper derives a 3D missile guidance strategy that minimizes the
total maneuver energy. The solution is derived using Pontryagin's
minimum principle. An interesting result is that the optimal guidance
law maintains the trajectory of the interceptor in a single plane
of motion. Therefore, the 2D result is used, and then lifted into
3D. The results is compared to pure proportional navigation and shown
to be much better. However, I do not think that the comparison is
fair. First, the OGL is an open loop strategy whereas PPNG is a feedback
strategy. Second, since we assume that the motion of the target is
known to the interceptor, it would be more appropriate to compare
OGL to augmented proportional navigation which uses this information
and also guarantees that the acceleration goes to zero at intercept.

The equations for 3D pronav are succinctly stated and are particularly
clear.},

The aim of this document is topropose a new method for solving the homography decomposition problem. This new methodprovides analytical expressions for the solutions of the problem, instead of the traditionalnumerical procedures. As a result, expressions of the translation vector, rotation matrix andobject-plane normal are explicitly expressed as a function of the entries of the homographymatrix. The main advantage of this method is that it will provide a deeper understandingon the homography decomposition problem. For instance, it allows to obtain the relationsamong the possible solutions of the problem. Thus, new vision-based robot control laws canbe designed. For example the control schemes proposed in this report combine the two finalsolutions of the problem (only one of them being the true one) assuming that there is no apriori knowledge for discerning among them.},

	Abstract = {In order for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to safely fly close to the ground, it must be capable of detecting and avoiding obstacles in its flight path. From a single camera on the UAV, the 3D structure of its surrounding environment, including any obstacles, can be estimated from motion parallax using a technique called structure from motion. Most structure from motion algorithms attempt to reconstruct the 3D structure of the environment from a single optical flow value at each feature point. We present a novel method for calculating structure from motion that does not require a precise calculation of optical flow at each feature point. Due to the effects of image noise and the aperture problem, it may be impossible to accurately calculate a single optical flow value at each feature point. Instead we may only be able to calculate a set of likely optical flow values and their associated probabilities or an optical flow probability distribution. Using this probability distribution, a more robust method for calculating structure from motion is developed. This method is being developed for use on a UAV to detect obstacles, but it can be used on any vehicle where obstacle avoidance is needed.},

	Abstract = {Abstract This paper describes a new approach for autonomous road following
for an unmanned air vehicle (UAV) using a visual sensor. A road is
defined as any continuous, extended, curvilinear feature, which can
include city streets, highways, and dirt roads, as well as forest-fire
perimeters, shorelines, and fenced borders. To achieve autonomous
road-following, this paper utilizes Proportional Navigation as the
basis for the guidance law, where visual information is directly
fed back into the controller. The tracking target for the Proportional
Navigation algorithm is chosen as the position on the edge of the
camera frame at which the road flows into the image. Therefore, each
frame in the video stream only needs to be searched on the edge of
the frame, thereby significantly reducing the computational requirements
of the computer vision algorithms. The tracking error defined in
the camera reference frame shows that the Proportional Navigation
guidance law results in a steadystate error caused by bends and turns
in the road, which are perceived as road motion. The guidance algorithm
is therefore adjusted using Augmented Proportional NavigationGuidance
to account for the perceived road accelerations and to force the
steady-state error to zero. The effectiveness of the solution is
demonstrated through high-fidelity simulations, and with flight tests
using a small autonomous UAV.},

	Abstract = {An adaptive controller design method based on neural network is proposed
for reconfigurable flight control systems in the presence of variations
in aerodynamic coefficients or control effectiveness deficiencies
caused by control surface damage. The neural network based adaptive
nonlinear controller is developed by using the backstepping technique
for command following of the angle of attack, sideslip angle, and
bank angle. On-line learning neural networks are implemented to compensate
the control effectiveness decrease and guarantee the robustness to
the uncertainties due to aerodynamic coefficients variations. The
main feature of the proposed controller is that the adaptive controller
is designed by assuming that all of the nonlinear functions of the
system have uncertainties, whereas most of the previous works assume
that only some of the nonlinear functions are unknown. Neural networks
learn through the weight update rules that are derived from the Lyapunov
control theory. The closed-loop stability of the error states is
also investigated. A nonlinear dynamic model of a high performance
aircraft is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
control law.},

	Abstract = {The ability to simultaneously localize a robot and accurately

map its surroundings is considered by many to

be a key prerequisite of truly autonomous robots. However,

few approaches to this problem scale up to handle

the very large number of landmarks present in real environments.

Kalman filter-based algorithms, for example,

require time quadratic in the number of landmarks to incorporate

each sensor observation. This paper presents

FastSLAM, an algorithm that recursively estimates the

full posterior distribution over robot pose and landmark

locations, yet scales logarithmically with the number of

landmarks in the map. This algorithm is based on an exact

factorization of the posterior into a product of conditional

landmark distributions and a distribution over

robot paths. The algorithm has been run successfully

on as many as 50,000 landmarks, environments far beyond

the reach of previous approaches. Experimental

results demonstrate the advantages and limitations of

the FastSLAM algorithm on both simulated and realworld

data.},

	Abstract = {The central task of GPS/INS integration is to effectively blend GPS
and INS data together

to generate an optimal solution. The present data fusion algorithms,
which are mostly based

on Kalman filtering (KF), have several limitations. One of those limitations
is the stringent

requirement on precise a priori knowledge of the system models and
noise properties.

Uncertainty in the covariance parameters of the process noise (Q)
and the observation

errors (R) may significantly degrade the filtering performance. The
conventional way of

determining Q and R relies on intensive analysis of empirical data.
However, the noise levels

may change in different applications. Over the past few decades adaptive
KF algorithms

have been intensively investigated with a view to reducing the influence
of the Q and R

definition errors. The covariance matching method has been shown to
be one of the most

promising techniques. This paper first investigates the utilization
of an online stochastic

modelling algorithm with regards to its parameter estimation stability,
convergence, optimal

window size, and the interaction between Q and R estimations. Then
a new adaptive process

noise scaling algorithm is proposed. Without artificial or empirical
parameters being used,

the proposed adaptive mechanism has demonstrated the capability of
autonomously tuning

the process noise covariance to the optimal magnitude, and hence improving
the overall

filtering performance.},

Radar data collected during actual flight tests are compared to truth data as estimated using a global positioning system sensor to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm.

To explicitly address the obstacle initialization problem, the maps are parameterized using the inverse time-to-collision (TTC), which is independent of the ground speed of the MAV. Using bearing-only measurements, an extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is employed to estimate the inverse TTC, azimuth, and elevation to obstacles. A nonlinear observability analysis is used to derive conditions for the observability of the system. Based on these conditions, we design a path planning algorithm that minimizes the estimation uncertainties while simultaneously avoiding collisions with obstacles. The behavior of the planning algorithm is analyzed and the characteristics of the environment in which the planning algorithm guarantees collision-free paths for MAVs are described. Numerical results show that the proposed method is successful in solving the path planning problem for MAVs.},

for power systems is explored in this paper. The designs are based
on nonlinear discrete-time predictive control and feedback linearizing
control, considering a simplified nonlinar single-machine, infinite
bus power system model equipped with a series-capacitor controller.
Simulations are presented for nonideal conditions such as bounded
control, the uncertainties in the chosen model parameters, and the
presence of inter-area-type persistent disturbances. The results
indicate that superior performance can be obtained using the nonlinear
predictive controller when compared with the feedback linearizing
controller and a standard linear quadratic regulator. },

	Abstract = {Flying ?xed-wing miniature air vehicles (FW-MAVs) in urban terrain
is a challenging

task because of unstructured urban environments, the minimum speed
requirement for

?ight of ?xed-wing vehicles, and the non-holonomic characteristics
of FW-MAVs. While

traditional path-planning algorithms can e?ectively overcome many
of these constraints,

if the FW-MAV detects new obstacles in-?ight that were not included
in the initial path-

planning, immediate action must be taken to avoid collision. Re-planning
with traditional

path-planning algorithms is not feasible due to the time required
to plan an entire path.

Therefore, a reactive collision avoidance system must be used to guarantee
obstacle avoid-

ance until a new path can be planned which includes the newly sensed
information.

In this paper we develop a reactive nonlinear collision avoidance
guidance law for FW-

MAVs ?ying in urban terrain. Our guidance law is designed for the
scenario where a wall

or other large object is observed. In this case, we would like the
FW-MAV to maintain a

speci?ed safe distance away from the obstacle over time. The algorithm
is developed using

Lyapunov stability theory, relative geometry between the FW-MAV and
the obstacle, and

sliding-mode theory. The FW-MAV reacts given the range information
between the FW-

MAV and the obstacle at a constant bearing. We show that our guidance
law guarantees

the convergence of distance between the FW-MAV and the obstacle to
the desired safe

distance. Simulation results show that the guidance law is successful
in navigating the

FW-MAV between zigzag walls, non parallel walls, curved walls, and
avoids sharp corners

successfully.},

The key idea is to use the epipolar constraint in the derivation of the nonlinear observer. Unfortunately the derivation of the observer equations is not very insightful. Also, I wonder about the fact that the observer for the rotation matrix is not constrained to SO(3).

	Abstract = {  Consensus algorithms for networked dynamic systems provide scalable algorithms for sensor fusion in sensor networks. This paper introduces a distributed filter that allows the nodes of a sensor network to track the average of n sensor measurements using an average consensus based distributed filter called consensus filter. This consensus filter plays a crucial role in solving a data fusion problem that allows implementation of a scheme for distributed Kalman filtering in sensor networks. The analysis of the convergence, noise propagation reduction, and ability to track fast signals are provided for consensus filters. As a byproduct, a novel critical phenomenon is found that relates the size of a sensor network to its tracking and sensor fusion capabilities. We characterize this performance limitation as a tracking uncertainty principle. This answers a fundamental question regarding how large a sensor network must be for effective sensor fusion. Moreover, regular networks emerge as efficient topologies for distributed fusion of noisy information. Though, arbitrary overlay networks can be used. Simulation results are provided that demonstrate the effectiveness of consensus filters for distributed sensor fusion. },

Three categories of encounter model were developed by Lincoln

conventional aircraft; one involving encounters with prior air

traffic control intervention and one without. The third category

of encounter model is for encounters with unconventional

aircraft---such as gliders, skydivers, balloons, and airships---that

typically do not carry transponders. Together, these encounter

models are being used to examine the safety and effectiveness of

aircraft collision avoidance systems and as a foundation for

Also this method does not require excessive online computations like
the recently popular state dependent Riccati equation (SDRE) technique.
Furthermore, it provides a closed-form non-linear feedback controller

	Abstract = {Recent advances in many multi-discipline technologies have allowed small, low-cost fixed wing unmanned air vehicles (UAV) or more complicated unmanned ground vehicles (UGV) to be a feasible solution in many scientific, civil and military applications. Cameras can be mounted on-board of the unmanned vehicles for the purpose of scientific data gathering, surveillance for law enforcement and homeland security, as well as to provide visual information to detect and avoid imminent collisions for autonomous navigation. However, most current computer vision algorithms are highly complex computationally and usually constitute the bottleneck of the guidance and control loop. In this paper, we present a novel computer vision algorithm for collision detection and time-to-impact calculation based on feature density distribution (FDD) analysis. It does not require accurate feature extraction, tracking, or estimation of focus of expansion (FOE). Under a few reasonable assumptions, by calculating the expansion rate of the FDD in space, time-to-impact can be accurately estimated. A sequence of monocular images is studied, and different features are used simultaneously in FDD analysis to show that our algorithm can achieve a fairly good accuracy in collision detection. In this paper we also discuss reactive path planning and trajectory generation techniques that can be accomplished without violating the velocity and heading rate constraints of the UAV.},

@article{Smoot2012,
	Abstract = {Motivated by recent commercial development of airborne wind energy, the conceptual design of tethered platforms is investigated. Airborne wind energy focuses on harvesting power from wind through nontraditional methods. Some of the ideas include commercial scale electric turbines for the upper atmosphere, using tow devices to assist in shipping or portable light wind generators. Different from current turbines, these systems do not have large masts and blades but instead use a tethered flying body to transmit energy. The vehicle at the end of the tether varies depending on the energy harvesting method but all fall under the broader category of the towed body. In contrast to modeling and analysis techniques specifically tailored to evaluate performance of individual types of towed bodies, a methodology for designing efficient, stable wings for towed bodies is developed. Static performance can be characterized by a minimal set of design parameters. This minimal set is derived through dimensional analysis showing that the static performance is dependent on a minimum of 3 parameters. These are chosen to be the ratios of effective lift to drag of the end vehicle, tether cross-flow drag to tether weight and effective lift to tether cross-flow drag. An experiment was performed to verify that two systems of different sizes with matching dimensionless design parameters would have similar dimensionless performance. To demonstrate the kind of design analysis that can be done, altitude is chosen as an example performance goal. Sensitivity studies show that for all the design parameters, there are value regions that are highly sensitive to changes in design parameter and areas that are flat. This means that increasing the effective lift to drag ratio beyond a certain threshold, for example, will give small increases in altitude. While the performance analysis is for generic towed bodies, the stability analysis focuses on rigid wings. Although similar to aircraft, attaching a tether to a flying object increases the amount of information to track and drastically alters modal and stability characteristics. By adapting some airplane analysis techniques to tethered systems the design complexity has been reduced, facilitating intuitive understanding for conceptual design. Static stability criteria is established similar to that of unrestrained aircraft, demonstrating the effect of bridling on static stability. Terms that relate trim and static stability are derived. A simple linear model is also developed for quick evaluation of stability. Stability derivatives from unrestrained aircraft analysis are combined with tether derivatives that give the change in tether force at the attachment point only. The linear model has 12 modes, 6 for the translation degrees of freedom and 6 for the rotational degrees of freedom. A method is presented for determining an optimal performance design. This is done by forming a constrained optimization problem to minimize the cost. The method is demonstrated in the design of a kite to break the single-line kite altitude record. The cost function includes estimates of tether cost and the price of materials for kite construction. Constraints include limits on aerodynamic and structural characteristics along with performance constraints such as required altitude. A stable planform and bridle position are then chosen using the analysis tools developed. Although a full scale design is not built, a sub-scale model, scaled according to the rules derived in the thesis, is flown to demonstrate the feasibility of the design. Using this methodology, parameter studies for environmental inputs and material properties are done for the optimized system.},

@article{Stolle2003,
	Abstract = {An Unmanned Autonomous Vehicle (UAV) is equipped with a nose-mounted camera capable of pan and tilt rotation for the observation of ground targets. The two camera angles are adjusted automatically in order to keep the target in the camera's field of view. While the camera actuators are fast enough to keep up with vehicle motion, the limited range of the camera angles leads to the target getting out of sight. Therefore, target exposure is affected by wind. Furthermore, the relative position of the sun can lead to glare and image overexposure. While the effect of wind can be improved by commanding a sideslip angle, image overexposure is avoided by keeping the vehicle between sun and target. Thus, it is desirable of define maneuvers that result in maximum target exposure, and provide guidance laws to allow path following for these maneuvers. This paper presents initial results, obtained based on circular and elliptical maneuvers. The results were generated using an accurate non-linear Aerosonde UAV representation and environmental dynamic models. Simulated GPS data was used for the path following guidance. The complete path about the target at constant altitude and airspeed is specified simply by the desired orbital segment and course reversals at the segment boundaries. With camera pan limited to the forward 180{\&}deg;, this can achieve long term observation. A camera with minor 'look-back' range can provide continuous observation in a maneuver that employs both circular and elliptical segments.},

use but limited simulation work has been dedicated specifically to
issues associated with very small vehicles that cruise at slow speeds
near the ground. Development of satisfactory sixdegree- of-freedom
models of an MAV and SUAV were the first tasks to be tackled, along
with the integration of these models into the MultiUAV 2.0 simulation
environment. The second task was to model and integrate wind data
for complex urban flows into this simulation. This involved creating
modules to interface the simulation with CFD results and data obtained
through urban airflow experiments. An urban environment for the MAV
to fly through was constructed using the geometry of a likely COUNTER
flight test location. These basic elements coupled with future cooperative
control task assignment and path planning algorithms will complete
this engineering simulation.},

regenerate trajectories every 2.5 seconds.

The introduction of formation maneuvers is somewhat awkward, and

@article{WebbPrazenicaKurdilaKind07,
	Abstract = { The realization of vision-based, autonomous flight for micro air
vehicles presents numerous technical challenges in diverse fields
such as image processing, trajectory planning, control theory, and
microhardware design. This paper explores one aspect of the overall
problem: robust, real-time estimation of aircraft states from a set
of tracked feature points. This vision-based approach is realized
via an implementation of the implicit extended Kalman filter, a variation
of the classical Kalman filter that allows for nonlinear dynamic
models and updates from measurements that are implicit functions
of the state variables. The epipolar constraint, which is a geometric
relationship between the feature point position vectors and the camera
translation vector, is employed in this paper as the implicit measurement
in the Kalman filter. In order for the vison-based Kalman filter
to provide reliable state estimation, it must be robust with respect
to modeling errors in the dynamic propagator. This is especially
true because the aerodynamic forces and moments acting on a micro
air vehicle are frequently not known to a high degree of accuracy.
Furthermore, the algorithm must be robust with respect to noise in
the measured feature point positions in the image plane. This paper
explores both of these robustness issues using results from a micro
air vehicle simulation model developed at the NASA Langley Research
Center. In particular, a hierarchy of dynamic models, ranging from
a random walk model to a high-fidelity nonlinear micro air vehicle
model, is employed in the Kalman filter for a simulated micro air
vehicle trajectory with varying levels of measurement noise. It is
demonstrated that the visionbased measurement updates in the filter
are capable of compensating for significant modeling errors and filter
initialization errors. As would be expected, superior overall results
are achieved using higher-fidelity dynamic models in the Kalman filter.
The work presented in this paper represents the first step toward
the ultimate objective of incorporating vision-based state estimation
into the design of autonomous flight control systems for micro air
vehicles operating in urban environments. },

@article{Luo06,
	Abstract = {An essential determinant of the value of surrogate digital images
is their quality. Image quality measurement has become crucial for
most image processing applications. Over the past years, there have
been many attempts to develop models or metrics for image quality
that incorporate elements of human visual sensitivity. However, there
is no current standard and objective definition of spectral image
quality. This paper proposes a reliable automatic method for objective
image quality measurement by local spatial-frequency wavelet analysis.
The analysis is performed locally by dividing an image into 64664
pixel blocks, and transforming the data into wavelet domain and sub-band
image domain. A fast lifting wavelet algorithm is developed for computationally
efficient spatialfrequency deconstruction of images to extract the
features of edges in sub-band datasets. Wavelet analysis throughout
the spatial-frequency range with respect to noise, sharpness, brightness,
contrast, and modulation transfer function (MTF) reveals more detailed
information to relate the quality of an image to the interpretation
by using an artificial neural network to optimize weightings and
results in a promising quantitative measure of image quality. Experimental
results from using this method for image quality measurement exhibit
good correlation to subjective visual quality assessments. The proposed
approach with fast computation provides a potential metric for reliable
image quality quantification, allowing image quality to be automatically
evaluated following image capture/compression, but prior to permanent
storage in a database.},

	Abstract = { Keywords: optical flow structure from motion Comments: Several novel
structure from motion algorithms are presented which are designed
to more effectively manage the problem of noise. In many practical
applications, structure from motion algorithms fail to work properly
because of the noise in the optical flow values. Most structure from
motion algorithms implicitly assume that the noise is identically-distributed
and that the noise is white. Both assumptions are false. Some points
are easier to track than others and some points are easier to track
in a particular direction. The accuracy of each optical flow value
can be quantified using an optical flow probability distribution.
By using optical flow probability distributions in place of optical
flow estimates in a structure from motion algorithm, a better understanding
of the noise is developed and a more accurate solution is obtained.
Two different methods of calculating the optical flow probability
distributions are presented. The first calculates non-Gaussian probability
distributions and the second calculates Gaussian probability distributions.
Three different methods for calculating structure from motion are
presented which use these probability distributions. The first method
works on two frames and can handle any kind of noise. The second
method works on two frames and is restricted to only Gaussian noise.
The final method works on multiple frames and uses Gaussian noise.
A simulation was created to directly compare the performance of methods
which use optical flow probability distributions and methods which
do not. The simulation results show that those methods which use
the probability distributions better estimate the camera motion and
the structure of the scene. },

calculation in networks where communications between nodes

are corrupted by additive noise. Specifically, given a fixed

network where each node has some given initial value, and

under the constraint that each node receives noisy transmissions

only from its immediate neighbors, we provide a distributed

scheme for any node to calculate an unbiased estimate of an

arbitrary linear function of the initial values. Our scheme

consists of a linear iteration where, at each time-step, each

node updates its value to be a weighted average of its own

previous value and those of its neighbors. We show that after

repeating this process with almost any set of weights for a

finite number of time-steps (upper bounded by the size of the

network), any node in the network will be able to calculate

an unbiased estimate of any linear function by taking a linear

combination of the values that it sees over the course of the

linear iteration. Furthermore, for a given set of weights, we

describe how to choose this linear combination to minimize

the variance of the unbiased estimate calculated by each node.

A special case of our results is a solution to the distributed

consensus problem, where each node has to obtain an unbiased

estimate of the same linear function.},

odometry algorithm which, by directly using pixel
intensity errors of image patches, achieves accurate tracking
performance while exhibiting a very high level of robustness.
After detection, the tracking of the multilevel patch features is
closely coupled to the underlying extended Kalman filter (EKF)
by directly using the intensity errors as innovation term during
the update step. We follow a purely robocentric approach
where the location of 3D landmarks are always estimated
with respect to the current camera pose. Furthermore, we
decompose landmark positions into a bearing vector and
a distance parametrization whereby we employ a minimal
representation of differences on a corresponding -Algebra
in order to achieve better consistency and to improve the
computational performance. Due to the robocentric, inversedistance
landmark parametrization, the framework does not
require any initialization procedure, leading to a truly powerup-

successfully evaluated in a set of highly dynamic hand-held

	Abstract = { Location: ref DB 7 Keywords: nonlinear optimal control, Gain margin
stability margins, robustness Comments: The robustness of nonlinear
rugulator for nonlinear systems with respect to variations in gain
is investigated. It is shown that there exists regulators that produce
asymptotically stable closed-loop systems, but do not tolerate any
variation in gain without instability. However, if the linearized
closed-loop system is also asymptotically stable, then there is always
some gain margin. For a wide class of optimal regulators, it is shown
that the gain margin is infinite with respect to increases in the
gain and that decreases down to 0.5 can be tolerated. The robustness
properties of linear quadratic control laws are thus generalized.

urban terrain. A world map is developed while the MAV flies through
the urban terrain. The basic idea is: (1) use a Harris corner detector
to identify features, (2) track the features using a Lucas-Kanade
algorithm, (3) compute structure from motion (4) use feature points
to learn a world map, which is represented using a quad tree. (5)
develop a finite set of possible maneuvers (6) use model predictive
control to select maneuvers that transition through the world map.

There are many opportunities to improve on what they are doing. },

	Abstract = {Hybrid systems which are capable of exhibiting simultaneously several kinds of dynamic behavior in different parts of a system (e.g., continuous-time dynamics, discrete-time dynamics, jump phenomena, switching and logic commands, and the like) are of great current interest. In the present paper we first formulate a model for hybrid dynamical systems which covers a very large class of systems and which is suitable for the qualitative analysis of such systems. Next, we introduce the notion of an invariant set (e.g., equilibrium) for hybrid dynamical systems and we define several types of (Lyapunov-like) stability concepts for an invariant set.We then establish sufficient conditions for uniform stability, uniform asymptotic stability, exponential stability, and instability of an invariant set of hybrid dynamical systems. Under some mild additional assumptions, we also establish necessary conditions for some of the above stability types (converse theorems). In addition to the above, we also establish sufficient conditions for the uniform boundedness of the motions of hybrid dynamical systems (Lagrange stability). To demonstrate the applicability of the developed theory, we present specific examples of hybrid dynamical systems and we conduct a stability analysis of some of these examples (a class of sampled- data feedback control systems with a nonlinear (continuous-time) plant and a linear (discrete-time) controller, and a class of systems with impulse effects).},

Systems, Infinite Dimensional Linear systems Comments: Control of
the distributed parameter systems (DPS) usually involves dynamical
descriptions on infinite-dimensional Hilbert or Banach spaces of
functions. For a linear stabilizable and detectable DPS, an infintie-dimesional
feedback controller exists so that the closed-loop system is stable.
However, this infinite-dimensional controller generally cannot be
implemented with practical computers and devices. Consequently, the
reduced order modeling of DPS becomes extremely crucial for finite-dimensional
controller design. In this thesis, Galerkin (or finite element) mehtods
are presented as a way to develop finite-dimensional Galerkin controllers
by approximating the infinite-dimensional stabilizing controller
for a class of linear DPS. This investigation will give a very simple
sufficient condition, i.e. the test of nonsingularity of a matrix
for a finite-dimensional Galerkin feedback controller to perform
as well as the infinite-dimensional stabilizing controller. },
